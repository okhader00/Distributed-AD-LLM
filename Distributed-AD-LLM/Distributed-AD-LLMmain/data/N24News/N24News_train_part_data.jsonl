{"text": "Sharon Tate, the tragic ingenue who epitomized the breezy Hollywood style of the late 1960s, has been gone for nearly five decades, but these days she seems anything but dead. With the approach of the 50th anniversary of her gruesome 1969 murder at the hands of the Manson family, which to many symbolized the end of the '60s, Ms. Tate is the subject of three coming films, including Quentin Tarantino's star studded \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,\" with Margot Robbie as Ms. Tate. But fans who cannot wait for the screen bonanza can get their own piece of the Tate legacy on Nov. 17, in an auction of a vast trove of designer clothing and personal possessions at Julien's Auctions in Beverly Hills, Calif. (Online and telephone bids will also be accepted.) The artifacts, which have been in the Tate family for five decades, are a boutique's worth of period fashion collectibles: Betsey Johnson minidresses (estimate: 600 to 800), a black Christian Dior minidress Ms. Tate wore to a film premiere in 1966 ( 15,000 to 30,000) and the ivory silk moire minidress from her 1968 wedding to Roman Polanski ( 25,000 to 50,000), as well as mod era sunglasses, scarves and jewelry. This a huge collection. Does it represent basically everything Sharon owned at the time of her death? Pretty much. I had it in my home for the longest time, and my home was broken into. Three pieces were stolen the wedding dress, the mink coat and then a mink that Sharon had made for my mother, which is in the sale. The police apprehended the culprits, and I got the items back. But that put me on high alert, and I went and rented a cold storage facility to store everything properly. Why did your family decide to keep so much of her stuff in the first place? There are people that cherish and almost worship and revere the circumstances of her death, so any of her possessions are extremely valuable to those kinds of people. This is why the family guarded them literally with our lives for all these years. I prefer to call it \"re homing\" her possessions. I was diagnosed with breast cancer, which also took the life of my younger sister at 42 years old. That was the first time I ever faced the reality that I wasn't going to be here forever, and what would I do with all of this stuff? I toyed with the idea of doing a museum so her fans could come, but as I looked into those type of things, they fail rapidly. So I decided it was much better to re home the collection to people that will love and adore and cherish these things as much as I have. It's time to share, right? Do you worry about pushback from the public over selling this treasured collection? I take a lot of guff from the trolls, people trying to blame my motivations. They are extremely insensitive. Honestly, I want it to go to people that will be in a better position to love it and cherish it as my family has, as Sharon did, and see it go into the future as far as possible. A lot of these designer clothes would look utterly on trend today. Do you think anyone might actually buy these items to wear, not just collect? If they have the right dimensions they might. But the fact of the matter is, it's all over 50 years old, so they're very delicate. I don't know if I should tell you this, but I had one of the best patternmakers in the industry look at the garments, take measurements, and I made patterns on everything in the collection. So if I have the energy after all of this is done, I would like to do a little Sharon line for the everyday gal. Sifting through all these personal effects must have brought back a flood of memories for you. Just about everything did. Sharon and I had a unique relationship, because we were military brats my dad set up missile stations for the NATO nations so we were always traveling, often into a different country, and that makes it hard on keeping friends. So the only thing that you have really is each other. I was at the house in Los Angeles, where the pregnant Ms. Tate was murdered most of the summer. I actually wore some of these things. When they would go out to a private club, I'd often dress in one of her minis to go to the Candy Store, or the Daisy, or the Factory. And then fashion took a huge swing, and it was freestyle, and minimalistic. They needed a face and a body that was equally free spirited and un coifed, but yet beautiful and gentle, which is what the '60s were all about, right? I know your old brother in law Roman Polanski long ago signed over these items to your family. Are you still in touch with him? I have a great relationship with Roman. When we get together, it's like time stood still. I can see Sharon in Roman's eyes, and he evidently said the same thing about my eyes he could see her as well. Aside from his legal troubles, there have been allegations over the years that Roman lured Sharon into a seamy Hollywood scene. What was your view of their marriage? Sharon absolutely adored Roman. She was head over heels in love with Roman. There are a whole lot of people that have said things, but it's pure fabrication. Roman and Sharon were a true love story, that's what I observed. And I was there, the first person to meet him when she brought him to Sausalito to meet my mom and dad. Apparently you endorsed the Tarantino film after some initial doubts. Why? I had reservations about it at first. It's what I said to Quentin: \"Given your name and your style and the name Manson, people are going to have a natural assumption.\" Which I did as well. But he gave me the script to read. I did not have to sign an NDA. He trusted me, and I trusted him, and I think it's a wonderful story. I gave him my word that I would not discuss it. The only thing I can say is, it's a love story to the Los Angeles of that era. He's gone to great lengths to recreate entire streets of the period. I mean, everything about this movie is going to blow your mind. Back to the auction: Is there anything you are keeping for yourself? There are a few things that I just couldn't give up, so they will live with me, like her Chanel bag and a coverlet that was on her bed. When I go, I will pass those things to my daughter. Everything that I do with victims' rights, and my mother did before me, and my little sister, is not something that I want to pass on to the next generation. I don't want the burden to be passed on, you know what I mean?

{"text": "A woman with a roll of toilet paper around her neck. A man with lettuce on his head, bare chested in a sheet, delicately holding a large goblet of red wine. A child with small lilac angel wings posed atop a mound of again toilet paper, with siblings and parents looking on in the background. For weeks, people have been recreating works of fine art using household items and posting their tableaus on social media. At a time when museums are closed, galleries have shuttered and art education has largely moved online, these images have formed a living archive of creativity in isolation. Tens of thousands of recreations appear under the hashtags mettwinning, betweenartandquarantine and gettymuseumchallenge. Some have been made by arts professionals, but many of them are the skillful works of amateurs. Anneloes Officier believes that her household in Amsterdam started this spontaneous wave of imitative works. For a month, she has been collecting submissions and posting them on the Instagram account tussenkunstenquarantaine (a reference the Dutch television program \"Tussen Kunst en Kitsch,\" whose title means \"between art and kitsch\"). \"Over 24,000 contributions have come in through our hashtag,\" Ms. Officier, 31, said, adding that staff members from the Rijksmuseum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Louvre, the Getty and the Hermitage have taken part. The creators sometimes impose their own rules and restrictions, such as limiting the number of props or the time allotted to create a replica. These recreations recall the work of the artist Nina Katchadourian, whose series \"Lavatory Self Portraits in the Flemish Style\" was shot entirely in airplane bathrooms. They're part of a larger body of work, called \"Seat Assignment,\" in which she creates art during commercial flights. \"I was trying to make art under circumstances where art doesn't seem possible. It involves a kind of magic trick,\" Ms. Katchadourian said. \"It's not unrelated to the constraints people are under now.\" She's \"delighted and charmed\" to see that others are taking to the form. Francesco De Grazia, a 25 year old classical guitarist from Sicily, said that almost every concert and artistic event he had been looking forward to has been canceled, leaving him with plenty of time on his hands to dress up like a Caravaggio painting. \"The only possibility is to make use of the tools offered by the web while waiting for this nightmare to pass,\" he said. \"I hope I was able to make someone laugh.\" Although not normally a big fan of social media, Crystal Filep, a 36 year old urban planner from Wellington, New Zealand, decided to join in after her mother encouraged her to try her hand at the challenge. \"I was attracted to the bodily, tactile nature,\" she said. \"I had been spending an unhealthy amount of time in front of screens for virtual meetings, emails, spreadsheets.\" Turning away from work to take part in a creative exercise \"helped lighten things, and put things in perspective,\" Ms. Filep said. In interviews with more than a dozen participants in the challenge among them a Japanese actor living in London and a social worker from Azerbaijan every person mentioned the sense of lightness that came from pretending to be someone else for a moment. They also spoke about their love for art and museums. There are so many people who miss the quietly social act of looking at art with others. For now, they will have to make do with virtual gallery tours and riffs on famous paintings posted to Instagram. These embodiments of artworks have a historical precedent. Long before we were dabbing eye shadow on our lips and posing with toilet paper, people were donning makeup, holding props and posing rigidly in place for up to a full minute as part of a dramatic practice known as tableau vivant, or living picture. Historians have traced evidence of the phenomenon back to the 1700s, where it served as a form of entertainment and instruction. In 1760, a group of Italian comedic actors recreated Jean Baptiste Greuze's painting \"The Village Betrothal in Les Noces d'Arlequin\" as part of larger theatrical performance, and in 1781, children at the Royal Palace of Versailles supposedly participated in a series of tableaux vivants inspired by the paintings of Jacques Louis David and Eugene Isabey. The hobby picked up steam during the 1800s, and reached its peak around the turn of the 20th century. While the widespread use of photography and the availability of the cinema made the practice of tableau vivant seem less engaging, it never fully faded from sight. Every year, residents of Laguna Beach, Calif., dress up for the Pageant of the Masters, an event that has been referenced in popular culture (including on episodes of \"Arrested Development\" and \"Gilmore Girls\"). When restrictions on public life are lifted, participation in this social media challenge and several others that have emerged over the last month will surely wane. But some educators are hoping to keep the recreations going long after stay at home orders end. \"I'm definitely going to keep assigning this project,\" said Stacy Antoville, who teaches art at the Clinton School, a 6 12 public school in Manhattan. Like the rest of the city's residents, her students are \"dealing with a lot of trauma right now.\" Some are grieving losses; others are anxious about the future. They're having trouble focusing on schoolwork and art, but they rose to the tableau vivant challenge in a way Ms. Antoville didn't expect, gamely fashioning themselves as famous subjects like Frida Kahlo and Salvador Dali. \"I hope this can give them one good memory from this time,\" she said.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Style"}
{"text": "Two hours before the W.W.E. Live Road to WrestleMania took over Madison Square Garden last month, John Cena, its star wrestler, burst into a backstage room. Stopping only for a quick handshake and amiable greeting (\"Grab a seat! Let's talk!\"), he sat before a stack of self portraits, grabbed a Sharpie and began feverishly scribbling his autograph like a teenager rushing to finish his homework. Dressed in a neon green T shirt, matching wrist bands, denim shorts and black kneepads, Mr. Cena looked like an action figure version of himself, as he pumped himself up for a long night of engagements, both in and out of the ring. There was a fan meet and greet for Make a Wish, wrestling executives to confer with and a promotional video to shoot, not to mention a Mixed Tag Team Match before 13,000 fans with his fiancee, Nikki Bella. They would face off against the guitar strumming Elias and Bayley. Mr. Cena's schedule had been nonstop in recent days. After a 30 hour stay in London to promote the film \"Blockers,\" a raunchy comedy about parents hellbent on saving their teenage daughters' virginities (he plays one of the overbearing fathers), he was in New York to reclaim his wrestling throne. For more than a decade, Mr. Cena has been one of the most bankable faces on the W.W.E. circus of oiled up pectorals. On a roster that leans heavily on burly windbags spewing sarcastic quips, he stands out as the squeaky clean, flag saluting role model devoid of divisive edge. His catchphrase is \"Hustle, Loyalty, Respect.\" The do gooder shtick may explain his wide appeal to preteen boys and their parents alike. But now he is expanding his reach, starring in more adult minded comedies like \"Blockers,\" in which he stuffs a pair of panties in his mouth in the opening scene. (The movie opens April 6.) \"I'm a 40 year old man,\" he said with a brutish laugh, pausing to look up from signing autographs. \"I have an adult sense of humor, O.K.?\" After finishing up the autographs, he popped out of his seat and made his way deeper backstage, past giant forklifts that were prepping the Garden for the big wrestling night. A jittery talent wrangler in a dark suit finally appeared to escort him to the Make a Wish meeting on the other side of the arena. But he kept getting interrupted. Cesaro, a wrestler from Switzerland wearing a too small gray tank top and tight black shorts, stopped him outside the stage entrance to inquire about dinner plans. \"No matter how hard pressed you are or how early your flight is, every time after the Garden we go out and get dinner,\" Mr. Cena said. \"Come hungry and leave satisfied.\" A few minutes later, Michael Hayes, a W.W.E. executive in a white trench coat and black bowler hat with bleached blond hair spilling out, came up to discuss Mr. Cena's debut match that evening with Ms. Bella. They talked in hushed tones, as if conspiring on a top secret plan. \"You're cool with that?\" Mr. Hayes said, after they apparently reached an agreement. \"Yessir! And there ya go!\" Mr. Cena said. His own journey was not so neatly choreographed. Raised in the suburb of West Newbury, Mass., Mr. Cena began weight lifting at age 12. After graduating from Springfield College, he moved to Los Angeles, toyed with becoming a professional bodybuilder, but switched his focus to wrestling after striking up a friendship with the wrestler Mike Bell, who died in 2008. Mr. Cena briefly wrestled for Ultimate Pro Wrestling, an independent outfit based in California, before signing with W.W.E. in 2001. He made his television debut a year later when Vince McMahon, the chairman of W.W.E., agreed to let him replace a wrestler who had come down with the flu. He lost the fight but won over fans when he began trash talking opponents using freestyle rap. As his fame grew, Mr. Cena evolved his character and, in an effort to appeal to younger fans, became a brute with a bleeding heart. He was now one of the good guys. Back at the Garden, Mr. Cena finally made it to the Make a Wish meet up, which took place in a classroom outfitted with rows of chairs and a W.W.E. backdrop. He greeted Garrett Richardson, a 15 year old in a wheelchair who wore a baseball cap that read \"Never Give Up,\" another one of Mr. Cena's catchphrases. Mr. Richardson and his family had flown in from Charlotte, N.C., to meet Mr. Cena and see the match. Mr. Cena has granted more than 500 Make a Wish requests over the years, so when Mr. Richardson was left speechless by the larger than life celebrity in the room, Mr. Cena knew just how to respond. \"Ah, I see your strategy,\" Mr. Cena said with a wink. \"You're saving all your energy for tonight's show. If you get too excited now, you'll have no voice by the third match.\"", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Style"}
{"text": "For some publishers unsettled by a fast changing online advertising business, sponsored content has provided much needed relief. In recent years, publications large and small have invested in teams to make sponsored content written stories, videos or podcasts that look and feel like journalistic content hoping to make up for declines in conventional advertising. To varying degrees, they have succeeded. Younger companies like Vice and BuzzFeed have built whole businesses around the concept. The Atlantic expects three quarters of its digital ad revenue to come from sponsored content this year. Slate, the web publisher, says that about half of its ad revenue comes from native ads, as sponsored content is also called, and the other half from traditional banner or display ads. Many major newspapers, including The New York Times, have declared sponsored content to be an important part of their strategies. But as the relationship between publishers and social platforms like Facebook grows closer and as more straightforward forms of advertising are devalued by ad blocking and industry automation, the role, and definition, of sponsored content has shifted. Now, publishers, social media companies and advertisers are negotiating new relationships. Audiences have migrated away from news websites and toward Facebook and other social media destinations, which for a competitive price can provide advertisers access to larger and more finely targeted groups of people, challenging the value of a publisher's own channels. With a weaker claim over audiences, publishers have been left to compete for advertising on different terms, leaning less on the size or demographics of their readerships, and more on the sorts of campaigns they can engineer for advertisers campaigns that are then used across the internet. \"The differences between five years ago and now, in client expectations, are enormous,\" said Keith Hernandez, the president of Slate. The resulting arrangements are more client agency than advertiser publisher, and advertisers are looking to media companies for a full range of services, from the production of campaigns to the often paid for placement of the content across the internet and social media. \"We have the basic building blocks of a full service agency,\" said Jon Slade, the chief commercial officer of The Financial Times. And The New York Times recently characterized the work of its T Brand Studio as \"platform agnostic.\" As it has for traditional editorial content, Facebook has become a primary distributor for many publications' sponsored posts, even though outside sponsored content was not officially permitted until April, when the social network published formal guidelines. Facebook's welcome of sponsored posts was broadly seen as a promising and necessary development. But some publishers were troubled by the manner in which Facebook said it would display sponsored posts and by how much power it put in the hands of advertisers. Under Facebook's system, all advertisers must be disclosed and displayed as co authors under the post or video, a level of disclosure that is required by the Federal Trade Commission. In addition, these advertisers are now privy to a wide range of information about their sponsored content posted on Facebook something that once was visible only to the publisher. They also get a deeper and more profound layer of data: They can see how much money was spent on Facebook promotion to drive traffic to the post in order to meet targets, a common and sometimes lucrative practice for publishers, who have been able to significantly mark up the price on such distribution. What's more, Facebook invites the advertiser to pay to promote their sponsored content on their own, making them less reliant on the publisher for distribution. Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions. 15 minimum wage for federal contractors will take effect Jan. 30. From Facebook's point of view, this transparency eliminates inefficiency why let middlemen charge extra for an audience that Facebook is selling? But for publishers who sold advertisers on their ability not just to create posts but to make sure they are seen, either through clever promotion or paid placement, such visibility can be deflating. This change poses a persistent and tantalizing question to increasingly savvy advertisers: Could we just attract eyes to our posts ourselves? And if not now, maybe soon? The change also discourages any illusions about how easy it could be for publishers to make money from native advertising. Sponsored content which, in 2016, often means video is expensive to produce and difficult to do well. Controlling distribution, albeit through Facebook, was for some a more profitable lever, and a way to pad deals that, while often growing in size, offered thin margins. This is, of course, a boon to advertisers. \"Many native campaigns are quite expensive, and if you limit the work you're doing to the creation of content, and leave the distribution to the brand, then it can become more affordable,\" said Stephanie Losee, head of content for Visa. With less ability to charge for distribution, on their own channels or others, and a growing dependence on margin squeezing outside platforms, publishers may be left to compete with creative agencies on their turf. Publishers becoming ad agencies, in other words, means competing not just with one another, but with the agencies that already exist. In this nascent new order, competitors are defined largely by their limitations. While the terms and prices that publishers can accept from advertisers are set by the need to support a connected news or entertainment organization the reason they chose this controversial path in the first place conventional agencies are hampered by a dependence on lucrative TV work, from which they are accustomed to low volumes and high margins. Accordingly, publishers' pitches often focus on price: their ability to create more content for less. Such a situation, in which publishers join a broader competition for advertising production dollars, would be a testament to how much and how quickly media distribution has changed. Publishers may get back in the running for advertising deals lost in recent years, but much like the editorial content they produce, their ads will succeed or fail in contexts over which they have less and less control. Bryan Goldberg, founder of the women's website Bustle, views these changes with optimism, at least as far as they affect larger publishers. \"Gross margins have slightly decreased, but not anywhere near enough to offset the upward movement in scale,\" he said. For smaller publishers, or those without backing from venture capital, the situation is less heartening. \"Running a full scale sales, marketing and operations team requires tens of millions of dollars of annual expenses,\" Mr. Goldberg said. Facebook, for its part, has provided a preview of how such a system might mature. A program that the company calls Anthology is meant to help video publishers \"lend brands their creativity, storytelling expertise and video production know how.\" It is being used by companies like Vox Media and Vice with advertising clients to produce videos that will then be promoted on Facebook.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Media"}

{"text": "Roseanne Barr has been a main attraction in ABC's annual presentations to advertisers the last two years. What It Was Like to Work on 'Roseanne' It was an incredibly exciting time to be a writer on \"Roseanne.\" The revived ABC sitcom was the No. 1 new show in the country, delivering an audience that network television had not seen in years. The show was quickly renewed for another season, giving everyone a sense of accomplishment, not to mention job security. But for all the success, there was also a vague sense of foreboding. The writers' social media accounts were flooded with negative comments. Articles posted online criticized jokes and plots. Their friends in the liberal enclave of Los Angeles would occasionally tsk tsk that they worked on the show. And, of course, there was Roseanne Barr, the show's star and co creator, and her history of volatile public comments. \"It was hard for us once we started airing and we started to see some of the stuff that came out,\" said Bruce Rasmussen, an executive producer of the series. \"It was just brutal: 'How dare they give her a show? How dare they write for her?' \"It was a certain amount of pressure,\" he continued. \"You're the No. 1 show, and people are coming after you on the web and you're getting attacked by 50 percent of the press.\" \"In the end, it came down to doing what's right and upholding our values of inclusion, tolerance and civility,\" Ben Sherwood, the head of ABC's television group, said in an email to employees on Wednesday. He added, \"The last 24 hours have also been a powerful reminder of the importance of words in everything we do online and on the air.\" By late Tuesday, Ms. Barr had returned to Twitter and, over several hours, sent or retweeted more than 100 messages. In one, she apologized to her crew for costing its members their jobs, and in another she apologized to Ms. Jarrett, blaming the drug Ambien for her racist tweet. But she also responded to a message falsely claiming that the ABC entertainment president Channing Dungey consulted with Michelle Obama about the show's cancellation. \"Is this true?\" Ms. Barr asked. She also retweeted a message from President Trump that said the Disney chief executive Robert A. Iger had never apologized to him \"for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC.\" And on Wednesday afternoon, Ms. Barr hinted that she might not leave ABC quietly. \"You guys make me feel like fighting back,\" she wrote. \"I will examine all of my options carefully and get back to U.\" One of the show's executive producers, Tom Werner, said in a statement that he hoped \"Roseanne seeks the help she so clearly needs.\" Ms. Barr's often controversial Twitter presence she is an outspoken supporter of Mr. Trump and has tweeted out messages espousing fringe conspiracy theories was nothing new to ABC. The network proudly promoted Ms. Barr as part of a broader strategy to appeal to more of the country after Mr. Trump's presidential election win. Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles. Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters. Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. The show's rebirth was the brainchild of Sara Gilbert, the actress who plays one of Roseanne Conner's daughters. Ms. Gilbert and other producers for the show felt that a comedy centered on a working class family would be perfectly timed to a moment when the country was so divided. But after the show premiered, there was growing frustration among ABC executives that Ms. Barr's Twitter controversies continued. Still, the network desperately needed a hit, perhaps a reason it was willing to let some of Ms. Barr's more outlandish statements go. \"Roseanne,\" along with the rookie drama \"The Good Doctor,\" has helped put the network on better footing, though it will finish the 2017 18 TV season in last place for the third straight year. Initially, the writers on \"Roseanne\" were able to work within a bit of a blissful vacuum. The entire season had been written and shot before the premiere episode aired in late March. Ms. Barr's on set presence had also mellowed significantly from what it was during the show's initial run in the 1990s, when she developed a reputation for being difficult to work with and treating her writers with little respect. Mr. Rasmussen, who was a supervising producer for one season on the old show before being fired, said there was a sense of purpose this time that the show could speak to a segment of the country that was often overlooked in prime time TV. \"Everyone trusted each other, and we were all on the same team,\" he said. But by time the show aired, things had changed, and the show had become a lightning rod. Mr. Trump and conservative commentators praised the show for its depiction of a Trump supporter, while some on the left expressed reservations about even watching it. And then there was the nagging, relentless presence of Ms. Barr's Twitter feed. \"We didn't know what was going to happen,\" Mr. Rasmussen said of her Twitter account. \"She would tweet stuff, then apologize and get off Twitter, and then it would get better. And then it would blow up again. I followed her to just see what was coming. Some of the other writers couldn't do it, just because they couldn't handle the stress of it.\"", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Media"}

{"text": "The Coen Brothers film \"Fargo\" ends, touchingly, with Marge Gunderson, the small town police chief played by Frances McDormand, talking to a criminal sitting in the back of her squad car (Peter Stormare). She had never witnessed the kind of violence that he and other men have perpetuated, and the events have shaken her, even as her infallible instincts have led her to the right conclusions. She inventories the five people dead over a failed kidnapping scheme. \"And for what?\" she asks. \"For a little bit of money. There's more to life than a little money, you know. Don't you know that?\" The montage that opens the disappointing final episode of this season's \"Fargo\" has Johnny Cash asking the same questions. (\"What is man? What has he done?\") And we get a tribute to the dead, most of them men in fedoras, with the exception of Swanee Capps: Doctor Senator, Gaetano Fadda, Rabbi Milligan, Odis Weff and Deafy Wickware, just to name a few major players. The war between the Cannons and the Faddas has resulted in heavy losses on both sides, all over \"a little bit of money,\" and there are still more losses to come, including the second Fadda brother, a local politician, the hospital administrator and the naughty nurse, Oraetta Mayflower. And for what? That's a question we might be asking of \"Fargo\" this season, but not in the way its creator, Noah Hawley, probably intended. From the start, this season posited itself as a story about American immigration and prejudice, about the alternative paths entire ethnic groups have had to take in order to gain legitimacy and how even those paths are limited for Black citizens. Ethelrida Smutny lays out those themes explicitly in the narration that opens and closes the season, every bit the good student with her thesis and concluding paragraphs. And yet, the body of the essay has been a bit of a mess. The missing element may be the lack of a Marge Gunderson, the sensible and relatable soul at the center of the chaos. There are some characters who might have qualified, like Ethelrida or Satchel or maybe even Milligan, but the action has been spread thinly across the ensemble, and a cartoonishness has ruled the day. Tonight's episode was the shortest of the season 39 minutes without commercials and felt the most deeply impoverished, with all the loose ends tied up hastily and a bow stuck on by Ethelrida in the final moments. Some of the plotting gets a little dodgy, too. Last week, Ethelrida gave Loy the pinkie ring that Oraetta lifted off Donatello Fadda, which relieved the Smutnys of their debt to the Cannons by providing Loy a much needed trump card. A lot of this strains credulity: Unless Ethelrida is a truly omniscient narrator, she knows nothing about the Faddas' business until her trip to the library, and even then she has an incomplete understanding of the situation. The fact that Oraetta kills patients as a matter of course makes it less outwardly likely, too, that she was in cahoots with Josto over his father's death. Nevertheless, it's plain that Ebal Violante should have been in charge of the family business all along, no matter his excuse for seizing power. After Loy spent a season gaining leverage by setting the Fadda brothers against each other and seizing on their weaknesses, Violante simply exercises the overwhelming power at his disposal. The way he frames it, the Cannons are like a ma and pa operation competing against one of the big chains: The Faddas are in every city and have the resources to crush the little guy. Kansas City is just a small piece of the business. He sees reneging on his deal with Loy as an act of mercy. (\"We are not taking half. We are leaving half.\") So much of the reckoning in this episode feels obligatory when it ought to be powerful. Josto gets a more muted version of a Bernie Bernbaum death march when he and Oraetta are marched to pit for execution, though it's funny, as a final act of perversity, for Oraetta to request watching him die before she takes her own bullet to the head. (We've been searching for motives for Oraetta all season, but the simplest explanation is that she was just a homicidal maniac.) Loy's death at Zelmare's hands seems like an egregious loss, too, after the ups and downs of watching him lose his business and regain his son. At best, the moment reads like another piece of Satchel's origin story, suggesting who he might become as an adult. (And the post credits scene, starring Bokeem Woodbine as the Season 2 character Mike Milligan, confirms it.) The season ends as Ethelrida puts the finishing touches on her \"history report,\" asking questions about who gets to tell histories about Americans whose pasts are segregated from one another's. But maybe the truest lesson comes from the Coens' brilliant \"Burn After Reading,\" which also ends as characters try to make sense of senseless violence. The question is, \"What did we learn?\" The answer: \"I guess we learned not to do it again.\" None Though Josto's death has the flavor of Bernie Bernbaum's being taken to the woods, the exact words Josto uses to plead for his life, \"You don't have to do this,\" is a callback to \"No Country for Old Men.\" Before his final hit in the film, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) reflects on how all his victims \"always say the same thing\" before he kills them. Chigurh does not have the capacity for pity. None Plaintive renditions of \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic\" and \"God Bless America\" on the same episode suggest the too muchness that has dogged the season over all. None \"Why didn't you tell me you're a demented hag?\" In Josto's world, where murder is business, it can't be easy to sort out the psychopaths from the garden variety murderous hoodlums.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Television"}
{"text": "It's taken a long time for \"Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch,\" Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett's 1990 end of days fantasy novel, to reach the screen. Long enough for Gaiman, then a promising comics writer and Duran Duran biographer, to become an industry: The Amazon Prime Video mini series \"Good Omens,\" which debuted Friday, is the third current television show based on his work, with Netflix's \"Lucifer\" and Starz's \"American Gods.\" And there have been other auspicious changes. When Gaiman and Pratchett made a Queen greatest hits CD a leitmotif in their book it's the preferred driving music of one of the heroes, a demon named Crowley it was a joke about the bombastic songs' late 1980s inescapability. Now it gives the mini series a soundtrack of pop classics. But what makes the diverting and mostly pleasurable \"Good Omens\" especially timely is something that hasn't much changed: Armageddon seems as real a possibility now as it did three decades ago. The story's hopeful universalism and ecological consciousness, which played well against the backdrop of the late Cold War and the ozone hole, feel just as necessary. A line like \"your polar ice caps are below regulation size for a planet of this category\" can go right from book to screenplay, and it has. Gaiman wrote the series's six episodes himself (Pratchett died in 2015), and in streamlining the book which was a digressive, more is more exercise in the tradition of \"A Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" he's made the wisest possible choice. The story is now focused even more closely on the central relationship between Crowley, the high living devil who kicks the plot into gear by misplacing the baby Antichrist, and the prudish angel Aziraphale, who works with Crowley in a desperate, covert, comical campaign to keep the world from ending. It's a good move because the book's sharpest and funniest writing was mostly in the Crowley Aziraphale scenes, and for the series Gaiman has reduced the time given to some of the duller material, like the appearances of the horsemen of the Apocalypse (here motorcycle riders) and the group of friends who beneficially influence the unsuspecting 11 year old Antichrist, Adam Young. (There's a visual shout out to Richmal Crompton's echt English \"William\" children's book series, a primary inspiration for \"Good Omens.\") And it's a great move because demon and angel are played, by David Tennant and Michael Sheen. It's hard to imagine better casting than Tennant as the cynical but softhearted Crowley, piloting his vintage Bentley at speed through central London, or Sheen as the timorous, dandified Aziraphale, maintaining his cover as an antiquarian book dealer while thrilling to the thought of lunch at the Ritz. Gaiman has added to the cast of Crowley's and Aziraphale's hellish and heavenly superiors, to reinforce the idea of their working to subvert divine plans, and this creates small, droll parts for performers like Jon Hamm (Gabriel) and Anna Maxwell Martin (Beelzebub). He's also added an amusing sequence showing the co conspirators' meetings through the ages, where we learn why the unicorn no longer exists and see a worried William Shakespeare (Reece Shearsmith) during rehearsals for \"Hamlet.\" (It's a nice in joke when Tennant, a notable contemporary Hamlet, offers advice to Richard Burbage, the actor who created the role, played by Adam Colborne.) The BBC Studios production is studded with piquant performances by veteran actors, mostly British. The great Bill Paterson is at his bemused best as Adam's exasperated neighbor, and Michael McKean and Miranda Richardson are fun to watch as the aging witchfinder, Shadwell, and his accommodating landlady, Madame Tracy. Sanjeev Bhaskar of \"Unforgotten\" is pleasingly oily as the libidinous lawyer, Baddicombe, and Derek Jacobi, no less, has a cameo as God's spokesman, Metatron. Gaiman's tweaks to the plot, along with explanatory animations and an unfortunately obtrusive narration by Frances McDormand as God, make the story more straightforward and take this as a description, not a judgment more cartoony, less writerly. Many fans of the book may be disappointed by what's been de emphasized, particularly the sentimental Anglophilia of the children's friendships and the notion that Adam is disinclined to wipe out humanity because he's too attached to his village of Lower Tadfield. It's easy to imagine a big budget feature version of \"Good Omens\" that would lean into the sentimentality while also giving more striking visual treatment to Adam's accidental reorderings of the world, like the sudden emergence of Atlantis and the appearance of tunneling Tibetans in Lower Tadfield. But it most likely wouldn't be as entertaining as this casual, somewhat shambling series, which catches the spirit of Gaiman and Pratchett's attempt, at the start of their careers, to keep topping each other with gags and comic set pieces. And among its copious jokes, \"Good Omens\" has the wit and good taste to mock \"The Sound of Music\" on multiple occasions. For that alone it deserves an Emmy.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Television"}
{"text": "ONE LONG RIVER OF SONG Notes on Wonder By Brian Doyle If you are in love with language, here is how you will read Brian Doyle's posthumous collection of essays: by underlining sentences and double underlining other sentences; by sometimes shading in the space between the two sets of lines so as to create a kind of D.I.Y. bolded font; by marking whole astonishing paragraphs with a squiggly line in the margin, and by highlighting many of those squiggle marked sections with a star to identify the best of the astonishing lines therein; by circling particularly original or apt phrases, like \"this blistering perfect terrible world\" and \"the chalky exhausted shiver of my soul\" and \"the most arrant glib foolish nonsense and frippery\"; and, finally, by dog earing whole pages, and then whole essays, because there is not enough ink in the world to do justice to such annotations, slim as this book is and so full of white space, too. Brian Doyle died in 2017 at 60 of complications from a brain tumor. He left behind seven novels, six collections of poems and 13 essay collections. The whole time he was writing, he was also working full time as the editor of Portland Magazine. This collection was one of our most anticipated books of December. See the full list. It's an amazing creative output, but Doyle was never famous. In 2012 The Iowa Review called him \"a writer's writer, unknown to the best seller or even the good seller lists, a Townes Van Zandt of essayists, known by those in the know.\" If there is a God and Doyle fervently believed there is \"One Long River of Song\" will change all that. This book is what Van Zandt's greatest hits would look like had he lived to be 60, and if every song on the record hit the bar set by \"Pancho and Lefty.\" Doyle was a practicing Catholic who wrote frequently about his faith, but this book carries not a whiff of sanctity or orthodoxy. The God of \"One Long River of Song\" is a kindergartner wearing a stegosaurus hat, a United States postal worker with preternatural patience (\"God was manning the counter from 1 to 5, as he does every blessed day\"), the \"coherent mercy\" that cannot be apprehended but may be perceived by way of \"the music in and through and under all things.\"", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Books"}
{"text": "The story of the striving, first generation kid made good is a familiar one; Alvarez makes his ache. He excels in honors classes and is aware from a young age of a yearning to free his mother from \"the assault of the fruit industry.\" To do so, he knows he must outrun his geography a metaphor he comes to embrace literally when in high school he becomes a serious runner. \"When the rhythms of working class life cut inside me like broken beer glass, I run,\" he writes. He wins a full scholarship to Whitman College in Walla Walla, but is thwarted by his own high expectations and shame about his upbringing. The dining hall presents a challenge, as does going to class and staying on top of assignments. Only while running does he feel solid in his skin. At a conference, he learns about Peace and Dignity Journeys, a six month long quadrennial run through the whole of North America, in which \"numerous and diverse Indigenous nations reunite and reclaim dignity for their families and communities.\" Pacquiao, the calm young man in charge of the journey, speaks of running as \"connective tissue,\" \"a form of prayer\" that \"renews our responsibility to community.\" Alvarez drops out of college to join the group, never more than a couple dozen runners, in one of its early stops in British Columbia, and the intricately threaded narrative about his family morphs into a journal of his travels on foot, and also, at times, in the vans the runners use to transport themselves and their supplies in their relay style race across the continent. As they go, they learn the different ways \"the rain strikes, strums and plucks at our skins.\" They run through mountainsides, forests, small towns and large urban blocks. When they are dropped off for a shift, they receive few instructions. \"When in doubt, turn left,\" is a motto. Food is scarce. Sometimes Alvarez's language seems vague and overly laden with the weight of his mission. (\"People's paths are unique, beautiful,\" he notes to himself upon meeting a new recruit to the team.) At other times, it's not clear how this epic run, with its attendant difficulties, relates to Alvarez's desire to help his family. At one point, alone on the trail in Oregon, he meets a snarling mountain lion. At the last minute, recalling instructions from an older runner about surviving such encounters, he remembers to \"thank the animal.\" Moreover, some of the marathon's leaders behave in ways that border on sadistic. The majority of the runners are recovering addicts or otherwise seeking redemption, and, like many of them, Alvarez believes in the transformative power of extreme sacrifice. \"I run to follow as closely as I can the path of those who came before me,\" he insists. \"I run to find fragments of my own parents sprinkled over the earth.\" When the group enters his home state of Washington after a month of running, he realizes he is \"submerging myself in pain ... so that I may control the turmoil within me.\"", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Books"}
{"text": "Nearly a century ago, the publisher Alfred A. Knopf released a slim book of spiritual fables by an obscure Lebanese American poet and painter named Kahlil Gibran. Knopf had modest expectations, and printed around 1,500 copies. Much to his surprise, the book titled \"The Prophet\" took off. It became a huge hit, and went on to sell more than nine million copies in North America alone. Until now, the publishing house that still bears Knopf's name has held the North American copyright on the title. But that will change on Jan. 1, when \"The Prophet\" enters the public domain, along with works by thousands of other artists and writers, including Marcel Proust, Willa Cather, D. H. Lawrence, Agatha Christie, Joseph Conrad, Edith Wharton, P. G. Wodehouse, Rudyard Kipling, Katherine Mansfield, Robert Frost and Wallace Stevens. This coming year marks the first time in two decades that a large body of copyrighted works will lose their protected status a shift that will have profound consequences for publishers and literary estates, which stand to lose both money and creative control. But it will also be a boon for readers, who will have more editions to choose from, and for writers and other artists who can create new works based on classic stories without getting hit with an intellectual property lawsuit. A 1923 copy of \"The Prophet.\" The work will enter the public domain on Jan. 1. \"Books are going to be available in a much wider variety now, and they're going to be cheaper,\" said Imke Reimers, an assistant professor of economics at Northeastern University who has studied the impact of copyright. \"Consumers and readers are definitely going to benefit from this.\" The sudden deluge of available works traces back to legislation Congress passed in 1998, which extended copyright protections by 20 years. The law reset the copyright term for works published from 1923 to 1977 lengthening it from 75 years to 95 years after publication essentially freezing their protected status. (The law is often referred to by skeptics as the \"Mickey Mouse Protection Act,\" since it has kept \"Steamboat Willie,\" the first Disney film featuring Mickey, under copyright until 2024.) Now that the term extension has run out, the spigot has been turned back on. Each January will bring a fresh crop of novels, plays, music and movies into the public domain. Over the next few years, the impact will be particularly dramatic, in part because the 1920s were such a fertile and experimental period for Western literature, with the rise of masters like F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway and Virginia Woolf. \"Eventually, these books belong to the people,\" said James L. W. West III, a Fitzgerald scholar. \"We can have new attempts to edit and reinterpret all of these iconic texts.\" Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

Once books become part of the public domain, anyone can sell a digital, audio or print edition on Amazon. Fans can publish and sell their own sequels and spinoffs, or release irreverent monster mash ups like the 2009 best seller \"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies.\" Vintage Classics is publishing a new edition of Robert Frost's \"New Hampshire,\" which will feature the original woodcut art and some of his best known poems, including \"Nothing Gold Can Stay\" and \"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.\" Theater and film producers can adapt the works into movies, plays and musicals without having to secure rights. Rival publishing houses can issue new print editions, and scholars can publish new annotated versions and interpretations. Free digital copies will circulate online. At the start of the new year, Google Books, which has more than 30 million works scanned in its vast online digital library, will release full digital editions of works published in 1923, among them Edgar Rice Burroughs's \"Tarzan and the Golden Lion\" and Edith Wharton's \"A Son at the Front.\" It's difficult to say exactly how many works will enter the public domain this January, because some authors and publishers allowed their copyright to lapse, and some foreign language books first published overseas in 1923 may remain under copyright for now, like Felix Salten's \"Bambi.\" More than 130,000 copyright registrations were filed in 1923 for various creative works, but most of those were not renewed, according to John Mark Ockerbloom, a digital library strategist at the University of Pennsylvania. Some publishers and the writers' heirs fear that losing copyright protections will lead to inferior editions with typos and other errors, and to derivative works that damage the integrity of iconic stories. \"Publishers are right to be concerned about a proliferation of unreliable editions, some of them probably not very good,\" said John Kulka, the editorial director of Library of America, a nonprofit organization that publishes American literary classics. Still, many scholars and legal experts argue that American copyright law, which is mind numbingly complex, has skewed toward enriching companies and the heirs of writers and artists at the expense of the public. When the first Copyright Act was passed in the United States in 1790, the maximum term was 28 years. Over the decades, lawmakers repeatedly prolonged the terms, which now stretch to over a century for many works. \"It's worse than the tax code,\" said Rebecca Tushnet, an intellectual property expert at Harvard Law School. \"The copyright term is way too long now.\" Next year, Penguin Classics is publishing new editions of several works from 1923, including Jean Toomer's \"Cane.\" Some studies show that extending copyright can actually have a negative impact on the sales and availability of books. A few years ago, Paul J. Heald, a law professor at the University of Illinois, used software that randomly sampled books available on Amazon, and discovered that there were more new editions of books published in the 1910s than from titles published in the 2000s. Publishers often stop printing books that aren't selling, but still retain the copyright, so no one else can release new editions. Once the books enter the public domain, a wider variety of new editions become available again, filling in a hole in the public and cultural record. Legal experts say that Congress is unlikely to pass yet another copyright extension because the political dynamics have shifted over the decades, with growing public opposition to stringent intellectual property protections. For readers and book buyers, the proliferation of competing texts and editions will mean more selection and cheaper books. In 2019, the digital publisher Open Road Media is publishing around a dozen newly available works from 1923, including e books of Jean Toomer's \"Cane,\" Gibran's \"The Prophet,\" Sigmund Freud's \"The Ego and the Id,\" P. G. Wodehouse's \"The Inimitable Jeeves\" and Christie's \"The Murder on the Links,\" one of her early novels featuring the detective Hercule Poirot. Legacy publishers are also snapping up newly available works. Penguin Classics is releasing new editions of \"Cane,\" Gibran's \"The Prophet\" and Proust's \"The Prisoner.\" Vintage Classics is publishing a new edition of Robert Frost's \"New Hampshire\" which will feature the original woodcut art and some of his best known poems, including \"Nothing Gold Can Stay\" and \"Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening\" as well as Dorothy Sayers's \"Whose Body?\" and three new editions of classic Agatha Christie novels. In anticipation of a flood of new editions of Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\" when the copyright expires in 2021, the Fitzgerald estate and his publisher, Scribner, released a new edition of the novel in April, hoping to position it as the definitive version of the text. The novel has sold around 30 million copies worldwide, and continues to sell more than 500,000 copies a year in the United States alone. But in two years, anyone with a laptop will be able to publish an e book of the text, or sell fan fiction based on the story. An early copy of \"The Great Gatsby,\" whose copyright expires in 2021. Fitzgerald's estate and his publisher, Scribner, released a new edition of the novel in April, hoping to position it as the definitive version of the text. Blake Hazard, Fitzgerald's great granddaughter and a trustee of his estate, said she hoped some interesting new interpretations of the story would emerge. But she also worries about what would happen to the novel's legacy when the inevitable homages and retellings land, which will probably include unauthorized Gatsby sequels or novels told from Daisy Buchanan's perspective. \"I hope people maybe will be energized to do something original with the work, but of course the fear is that there will be some degradation of the text,\" Ms. Hazard said. But publishers who specialize in classics see a tremendous opportunity to reintroduce old works. Some have been planning for this moment for decades. Penguin Classics had a number of 1923 titles lined up for 1998, when the copyright for books published that year was set to lapse, but those plans were scrapped after Congress extended protections. About three years ago, Penguin's editorial team went back to their list of 1923 titles and began looking for classics that still resonate and sell well. Several jumped out, including \"The Prophet.\" John Siciliano, the executive editor of Penguin Classics, wanted something to distinguish its edition of \"The Prophet\" from the others, so he decided to commission a new introduction from a contemporary poet. \"I'd been thinking of who the perfect person would be, someone like Kahlil Gibran, a poet with mass appeal,\" he said. \"It became obvious that Rupi Kaur was the one.\"", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Books"}
{"text": "At the Dance for George in Harlem on Sunday the mood alternated between euphoric and somber. As protesters streamed through the streets of New York on Sunday afternoon, one group's chants of \"Black lives matter!\" and \"No justice, no peace!\" gave way to a sound more often heard at weddings and block parties. On 125th Street in Harlem, hundreds of people, many of them professional dancers, had congregated for a peaceful march across town and a collective performance of the Electric Slide. The sea of grapevining, step touching demonstrators, who filled a plaza near Malcolm X Boulevard, had been called together by two New York dancers, Sheen Jamaal, 27, and Alison Bedell, 24 (also known as Buttons). The event, Dance for George, paid tribute to George Floyd and called attention to the work of black artists at the heart of the dance and entertainment industries. Every so often the jostling line dance would reshape itself into a circle, with dancers freestyling at the center as the packed crowd cheered them on. (A mix of \"Electric Boogie\" spliced with hip hop and R B classics had been prepared for the occasion.) The alternately euphoric and somber gathering after the dancing came a silent, nine minute kneel is just one instance of dance intersecting with protest over the past two weeks of global demonstrations against racism and police brutality. Widely shared videos have shown a rendition of the Cupid Shuffle on the streets of Newark; an offering of bomba, an Afro Puerto Rican tradition, from a young protester in Loiza, Puerto Rico; and a jingle dress dance, a healing practice rooted in Ojibwe culture, performed in Minneapolis as a prayer for Mr. Floyd's family Scroll through social media, and you might also find twerking in New Orleans, Senegalese Sabar in Los Angeles and the Haka (an ancient Maori war dance) in New Zealand, all proclaiming through the body that black lives matter. The examples are so abundant that one hip hop dancer and scholar, MiRi Park, has created a public Google document listing occurrences of dance as protest since May 26, together with further reading on the subject. It expands every day. At the center of many of these videos are dancers expressing pain and joy affirming that they are alive. Some came to the streets with the purpose of dancing. Others were moved to dance more spontaneously, and surprised to find themselves seen by millions online. Dancers from three cities, featured in three videos, spoke about what it has meant to them to dance in protest. At a march in Lower Manhattan last week, three men who had never met were drawn to the same drumbeat. Fabricio Seraphin, Nathan Bunce and Areis Evans had gathered around a group of musicians, and during a pause in the procession, they broke into dance. A video of their exuberant, unplanned dance circle recorded and shared on Instagram by another protester, Antoinette Henry has now been viewed well over two million times. In phone interviews, Mr. Seraphin, Mr. Bunce and Mr. Evans said they were not dancing with cameras in mind. \"It all came together naturally,\" said Mr. Bunce, 47, an artist and teacher who lives in Brooklyn. \"It was a big release for me.\" Each dancer brought a distinctive style to the circle. Mr. Bunce said he was paying homage to New York's underground house scene, while invoking Haitian, South African and West African traditions of honoring ancestors through dance or as he put it, \"speaking to those that were here before me.\" Mr. Seraphin, 25, a contemporary dancer and circus artist living in Brooklyn, added ballet to the mix, with an ecstatic grand jete that translated the words on his T shirt \"black boy joy\" into movement. For him, joy is a form of resistance. \"You can take from us, but you cannot take our joy,\" he said. \"That is ours to give, ours to do with what we please.\" Mr. Evans, 33, a fitness and hip hop instructor who lives in Harlem, described expressing joy and pain at once. In his emphatic solo, he did not hold back. \"I was in tears,\" he said. \"The way my style is, I really want people to see the hurt.\" He tapped into these feelings with the support of strangers. \"I saw three black men actually come together; we didn't judge each other,\" he said. \"It was a brotherly moment, and I loved that.\" One night last week, Karma Munez, a dancer in Chicago's vogueing ballroom scene, proposed an idea to two of her best friends: to dress up, find a protest and vogue in the streets. The next day, the three put on their thigh high black boots, grabbed their speakers and joined a march in the city's Bronzeville neighborhood. The results have circulated in numerous videos online, in which the dancers fearlessly strut, spin, kick and dip, letting their bodies crash to the pavement, as other protesters cheer them on. In one moment, Ms. Munez (who also goes by Gorgeous Mother Karma Gucci, her ballroom name), dances in front of a row of police cars, flipping her hair in front of their flashing lights. \"I thought it was the best way to make a stand with the talent that we have,\" said Dhee Lacy (a.k.a. Adonte Prodigy), when the trio got together for a FaceTime interview a few days later. \"I didn't want to have to riot, and I think that ultimately people have different ways of speaking out.\" With its origins in black and Latino, gay and transgender communities, vogueing has always been a mode of resisting oppression. The dancers said that through their street performance, they were advocating for black L.G.B.T.Q. people, who are sometimes pushed to the margins of the Black Lives Matter movement. \"We wanted to stand up for ourselves, as well,\" said Amya Jackson (a.k.a. Amya Mugler), pointing to the brutal attack of a transgender woman, Iyonna Dior, by a group of black men during a recent Minneapolis protest. \"What about us?\" Ms. Munez noted that some online viewers mistook the performance to be celebratory. \"I feel like people misunderstand dancing, and they automatically assume that if I'm dancing, I'm happy,\" she said. \"Dance is not a celebration; it's an expression.\" The group known as Kalpulli Yaocenoxtli, which practices Mexican Nahua dance, song and drumming, is a frequent presence at Black Lives Matter protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul. Its dancers first took to the streets in solidarity with the movement after the death of Jamar Clark, who was shot and killed by Minneapolis police in 2015. \"An injustice to one of us is an injustice to all,\" said Sergio Cenoch, who directs the group with his wife, Mary Anne Quiroz, when the two spoke by phone just before a vigil for Mr. Floyd in Minneapolis. \"That's the message we want to convey when we're out there supporting.\" A recent video posted on Instagram by a Kalpulli member, Samuel B. Torres, shows the dancers in bright regalia, kneeling outside the Fifth Precinct of the Minneapolis Police Department. After leading protesters in a chant of \"George Floyd! Say his name!\" they leap to their feet to an accelerating drum beat. \"One of the dances that we do a lot is called Tletl, which is fire,\" Mr. Cenoch said. \"We do that to spark fire and have it be felt across everybody that is watching, to try to get them connected to what is going on, and get that fire within their soul lit.\" Ms. Quiroz added that the dances they bring to protests \"have survived colonization, have survived over 500 years.\" To keep them alive \"is a symbol of resistance,\" she said, noting the connections between the struggles of black and Indigenous people. \"It's a symbol of resilience.\"", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Dance"}

{"text": "In \"Healing Wars,\" which draws parallels between the American Civil War and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, she incorporates movement, storytelling, music, digital projections even flying hospital beds above the stage. Behind is an area that theatergoers will visit en route to their seats and where they will come into contact with characters played by, among others, the actor Bill Pullman; the dancer Tamara Hurwitz Pullman, his wife; and Mr. Hurley, one of several veterans who have contributed their stories in the project's development. \"This has always been part of Liz's thing, that it matters who's doing the performing,\" said Mr. Pullman, whose wife has a long association with Ms. Lerman. \"Whoever is doing the movement brings their own personal richness to it all.\" They've brought their own research, too: Mr. Pullman's father was a Navy surgeon in World War II, and he also based his \"Healing Wars\" character on Dr. Richard Jadick, a Navy surgeon in Iraq. Ms. Lerman's father, too, was a World War II veteran. Like many of their generation, neither man talked about his combat experiences. Which is a point of the show. \"When my father was on his deathbed he said, 'Bury me in my uniform,' \" Ms. Lerman said. \"We'd never heard anything about the war, but this was obviously huge to him.

{"text": "Ryan Hunter Reay made a breathtaking pass of Helio Castroneves with one lap to go and held on to win Sunday in one of the closest and fastest Indianapolis 500 races ever. Hunter Reay's victory margin of 0.06 second denied Castroneves a fourth victory in the 500 mile race. The winner's average speed of 186.563 miles per hour was second only to the pace of the 2013 race. Most of the race was run at a furious pace, in excess of 220 m.p.h., including the caution free first 350 miles a record. Third went to Marco Andretti, followed by Carlos Munoz, Juan Pablo Montoya and Kurt Busch, the Nascar driver who raced not only at Indy on Sunday, but also in a 600 mile Nascar race later that day in North Carolina. Busch, who finished 2.2 seconds back, was the race's highest finishing rookie. A restart after a red flag stoppage of the race set up a wild six lap dash to the finish, with a record 20 cars still on the lead lap. The lead changed hands with each successive lap, until Hunter Reay made a shocking dive almost into the infield grass to take the lead. \"It is a dream come true,\" said Hunter Reay, the first American born driver to win the Indy 500 since 2006. \"It hasn't really sunk in yet. But the dream has finally come true here today.\" In other racing news from a busy weekend: Jimmie Johnson furthered his aspirations of winning a record tying seventh driving championship by taking the checkered flag Sunday night in the 600 mile Nascar Sprint Cup event at Concord, N.C. A new qualifying system for a season ending playoff places a premium on winning races during the first two thirds of the campaign. Johnson, who notched his sixth Nascar title last year, had been winless through the first third of the 2014 season. Johnson took the lead with eight laps left in the 400 lap event, then held on to beat Kevin Harvick, Matt Kenseth, Carl Edwards and Jamie McMurray, who rounded out the top five. The race ended in disappointment for Kurt Busch, who had to start last after missing a mandatory prerace drivers meeting because he had been competing earlier in the day in the Indianapolis 500. He had worked his way through the field to challenge the leaders, but his car's engine expired two thirds of the way into the race. Nico Rosberg, the pole qualifier, managed to hold onto his position throughout Sunday's running of the Monaco Grand Prix and score a victory over his Mercedes teammate, Lewis Hamilton, and Daniel Ricciardo of Red Bull. Hamilton was within a second of the lead for much of the race. But he slowed in the late going, complaining of having something in his eye. He just managed to hold off Ricciardo; Sebastian Vettel, the defending champion of the Formula One series, retired with a mechanical failure. Rounding out the top five were Fernando Alonso of Ferrari and Nico Hulkenberg of Force India. Rosberg, Monaco's defending champion, broke the four race winning streak that Hamilton had going, and took over the points lead in the battle for the 2014 driver's title. Courtney Force won Sunday's Funny Car duel at the Kansas Nationals drag races, and in the process scored what the National Hot Rod Association said was the 100th victory for women in series competition. The achievement capped a run that began in 1976 with the pioneering racer Shirley Muldowney. A total of 14 women have added their names to the roster of N.H.R.A. final round winners over the years. \"This is for all the girls out there,\" Force said, \"in any type of sport.\" In other pro categories at Kansas, Spencer Massey won Top Fuel and Allen Johnson was tops in Pro Stock.

{"text": "ANN ARBOR, MICH. Lance Bowles knew his son Caden loved cars, but he didn't realize just how much until the summer when Caden was 6. \"This guy was driving by, and Caden said, 'Hey, Dad, there's an Isetta!' \" Mr. Bowles said, referring to a rather obscure Italian designed microcar from the 1950s. \"The guy turned the car around and said, 'Did he just call this an Isetta?' He couldn't believe it.\" Caden Bowles was, by all accounts, a smart, precocious and joyful boy with extraordinary ardor for automobiles. Though only 11 when he died last fall while awaiting a heart transplant, Caden left an enduring impression on nearly everyone his life touched, including the staff at the University of Michigan C. S. Mott Children's Hospital here, and Jean Jennings, the well known automotive journalist who runs the JeanKnowsCars website and is a judge on TruTV's \"Motor City Masters.\" Ms. Jennings's friendship with Caden resulted in a car show in his honor, held at the hospital last Saturday. Largely unpublicized and closed to the public, Caden's Car Show was intended to give young patients and their families a diversion from medical ordeals, and to raise awareness for organ and blood donations. At Mott, 26 children await transplants. A dozen of them need heart transplants. Held atop a parking structure on a sultry Saturday morning, the show featured nearly 60 cars most of them privately owned including classics, new models and novelties with child appeal. They included a 1922 REO Speed Wagon fire truck, a 1991 Ferrari Testarossa, a 2008 Lamborghini Reventon, a 1981 DeLorean, a 1975 Plymouth Fury police car, a 1930 Ford Model A and a 1925 Detroit Electric Model 95. A Mopar Muscle Ram monster truck and an Oscar Mayer Wienermobile sat at the valet entrance. The show required months of planning and had 16 sponsors, including several automakers. Even Mark Reuss, General Motors' executive vice president for global product development, joined the cause, driving to the hospital in his personal black 1954 Chevrolet Corvette from his home an hour away. \"This was her first road trip,\" Mr. Reuss said, smiling beside the car he had bought last year. \"Jean asked me to come, and I said yes,\" he explained. Patients were brought out in wheelchairs, sometimes shielded from the sun by umbrellas. Alexander Mugg, 5, sat for a photo session inside a '63 Corvair Greenbrier van that had been converted into a photo booth. Wearing a Detroit Pistons jersey, Alexander, who has cystic fibrosis, said he looked forward to the fire truck because he hoped to become a fireman. Quentin Zanders, 17, of Roswell, Ga., had been in intensive care after an abdomen procedure, but hoped to go home soon. He grinned behind the wheel of a 1965 Shelby Cobra 427 owned by John and Ann LaFond of Plymouth, Mich. \"I like the stripes,\" said Quentin, who expects to get his learner's permit this year. \"It looks like the kind of car you'd see in a James Bond movie.\" Patients unable to leave the hospital could see the cars from their windows or watch a video feed. Indoor activities included a photo booth, slot car racetrack and video games. \"I should tell my dad about this one,\" said Gavin Grubaugh, 7, of the racecar he propelled around the slot car track. \"I drifted!\" he exclaimed as his car went sideways, then shared a fist bump with his mother, Theresa Grubaugh of Standish, Mich. Gavin had gone through brain surgery a week earlier. Each of Mott's 350 patients received a bag of treats and toys, including Chevrolet trading cards and a Ford GT die cast model provided by Edsel Ford II. The night before, an event at Zingerman's Cornman Farms, a working farm and event venue in nearby Dexter, raised more than 50,000 for research on pediatric heart transplants and congenital heart disease. Called \"Full Throttle,\" after a name Caden gave to his written critiques and drawings of cars, the event featured a dozen vehicles, some owned by surgeons who had known Caden his whole life. Caden was born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, meaning his heart's left side had failed to develop. He needed, and received, a transplant, and lived a relatively normal life. But at 7 he was found to have cancer linked to immunosuppressant drugs. He overcame the cancer, but last year his heart began to fail; after a few months awaiting a new one, Caden died of a stroke on Sept. 11. Dr. Richard Ohye, head of the pediatric cardiovascular surgery division at Mott and the surgical director of the pediatric heart transplant program, brought his 1997 Ferrari 550 Maranello to the fund raiser. Overcome with emotion, Dr. Ohye said of the event, \"This is I can barely speak.\" The weekend was conceived by Ms. Jennings and facilitated by Dr. Edward Bove, chairman of the cardiac surgery department of the university's medical center. Ms. Jennings, whose cellphone screen saver is Caden's picture, met the young enthusiast when he was recovering from cancer. The friendship began with Meg Zamberlan, pediatric nurse practitioner and pediatric heart transplant program coordinator at the U M congenital heart center. She had been astounded by her young patient's sophisticated car chatter. \"He'd bring in this car encyclopedia, a foot and a half long, and he knew where each car was he wanted to talk about,\" she said. \"He had these long fingers and he'd point to this spec and that spec.\" She told a friend, who told Ms. Jennings, who wrote a column about Caden for Automobile magazine, where she was editor in chief at the time. Last year, when she learned Caden's heart was being rejected, she brought supercars the magazine was testing to the hospital. One time, Ms. Jennings brought an Aston Martin Vanquish and arranged for him to see it up close. \"The nurses were putting him in his wheelchair, and the whole time he was having this erudite conversation about engine displacement,\" she said. \"He figured they were just taking him for another test. Then they rolled him outside. I told him, 'Get out, go see it.' \" The next day, she brought an SRT Viper. \"He got in the driver's seat, and we arranged his little sweatshirt and socks and I took his picture,\" she said. \"Then I told him to push the start button, and he jumps about six inches out of his seat.\" Soon, doctors began bringing their own cars. Caden had many interests, including science, and especially the solar system. But most of all he loved his family and cars, and he didn't have a favorite. \"When he was very little, he used to wind up Matchbox cars and put them on our window sills and get at eye level and watch the wheels go around,\" said his mother, Shannon. \"His first words were \"round, round.\" Caden grew up in Fort Wayne, Ind., with his sister and two brothers. When Caden was hospitalized, Mr. Bowles, an accountant, and Mrs. Bowles, then a part time dietitian, often drove 2.5 hours to Mott. Caden, who dreamed of owning his own car company, to be called Bowleswell, had been hospitalized four months when he died. His eyes were donated, and his memory will live on through Caden's Car Show. \"It's humbling to think that Caden is the face of all this,\" Mrs. Bowles said Saturday, adding, \"It is his legacy, through this show, to help other kids going through what he went through.\"", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Automobiles"}
{"text": "HIGHLAND FALLS, N.Y. The Storm King Highway, a twisting two lane ribbon carved into a mountainside here nine decades ago, hardly seemed the place to test the roadworthiness of a hot rod that looked to have just escaped the junkyard. Of greater concern, perhaps, was that Peter Duvaloois had never traveled this road, some 50 miles north of Manhattan, before bringing his 1946 Chevrolet \"rat rod\" truck here to meet a reporter. On the Storm King Highway a four mile stretch of Route 218 that snakes along 400 foot cliffs overlooking the Hudson River and passes the United States Military Academy at West Point drivers must resist staring into the breathtaking vistas, even while keeping their distance from the low stone wall that serves as a guardrail. To Mr. Duvaloois, 62, rat rods like his home built pickup represent a return to the roots of hot rodding. Rat rod builders embrace vehicles that display a rebellious attitude, along with loud manners and an intentionally distressed appearance, not necessarily the qualities needed to deal with a demanding road better suited to sports cars or motorcycles. But Mr. Duvaloois seemed pleased, and possibly relieved, that his hot rod had taken the curves so competently. The hot rod movement that emerged after World War II drew young men it was overwhelmingly a man's pursuit who bought the hulks of prewar cars out of scrapyards for a few dollars and modified them for more speed. Fords from 1932 40 were preferred, especially for their flathead V8 engines, which were readily tuned to increase power. The bodies were stripped of fenders and hoods for a leaner look. By the late 1950s, hot rods were becoming elaborately customized vehicles, a trend that evolved to the point that pristine machines costing six figures and up became commonplace the antitheses of the genre's origins. Mr. Duvaloois is no stranger to that kind of car. Several years ago, he built a show quality hot rod and then barely drove it. \"I was afraid to park it anywhere,\" he said. \"I wasn't having any fun with it.\" He turned his skills to building rat rods, a growing branch of the hobby that is as dedicated to drivability as it is to individual expression. \"Rats are really back to basics,\" he said. \"You scrounge around or trade for parts, and what you can't find you make yourself. That's a big part of the fun.\" The scavenger hunt and hand building aspects come naturally to Mr. Duvaloois: With his wife, Cathy, he restored their 308 year old house in Saugerties and built period style furniture for it. The house had belonged to his father, who worked on it for many years before Alzheimer's limited him. \"We finished it, and my father was able to see it completed before he died,\" Mr. Duvaloois said. \"That's something I'm really proud of.\" From his father, he also picked up his affection for cars. \"As a kid, I'd be in the garage with my dad in middle of winter, working on engines,\" he said. \"He could build anything.\" Building a rat rod, Mr. Duvaloois said, begins with an inspiration, usually a favorite body style or even one part. \"It can be just a grille or a headlight shape or taillight design you really like,\" he said. \"You create your vision around that.\" Inspiration for the vehicle he was driving this day, one of four that he has built, came from the cab of a derelict 1946 Chevrolet truck that he bought locally for 200. The floors had rusted out and there was no chassis. That didn't matter to Mr. Duvaloois, who builds his own steel frames. \"It's much stronger than the original chassis ever was, and it allows me to set the vehicle stance and height to get the particular look I'm after,\" he explained. Mr. Duvaloois installed a 1937 Ford front suspension and built his own rear suspension. And he made just about everything else, always with an eye toward creating a certain vintage patina. \"If you do it correctly, people think you found it in a barn,\" he said. \"You make it look like it's been around for 50 years.\" Mr. Duvaloois, who worked for many years as a mechanic in pharmaceutical packaging, lays out the chassis and body relationship using wood and paper forms. In his workshop, he altered the cab considerably, slicing it lengthwise to take out 6 inches of width. He also narrowed the hood and metal dashboard and lowered the roof by 4 inches. The welded seams were left exposed. The bed was fabricated from sheet steel, then distressed to match the cab. What little paint remains on the cab is original. Surface rust was left untouched, per the rat rodder's credo conveyed on a windshield decal: \"In rust we trust.\" Despite the truck's deliberate lack of polish, the builder's attentive touch is revealed in various details. The taillights, for instance, come from a utility trailer, but their intricate spider web garnishment is Mr. Duvaloois's own metalworking. \"I see rats as works of art, and there's a cartoonish aspect I really like,\" he said. Mr. Duvaloois acknowledged that he and other rat rodders took inspiration from the exaggerated forms of the Rat Fink cartoons of Ed Roth, known best by his Big Daddy signature. While many rat rodders install Chevrolet V8s for their affordability and vast availability of parts, Mr. Duvaloois prefers an engine noted mostly for its brawn: Chrysler's Hemi V8 of the 1950s. His truck uses a 241 cubic inch Dodge version called a Red Ram. \"You really have to look for these things,\" he said, reveling in the challenge of the hunt. \"It's harder to find parts.\" He also relishes the sound of old Hemis, a distinctive dialect among American V8s, one that's especially memorable when blasted through his truck's minimalist mufflers. On the road, the unruly rappatta, rappatta, rappatta at low speeds evened out to a baritone bellow at cruising speed, then escalated to a peculiar warbling snarl as speed increased. Mr. Duvaloois wears earplugs on long highway drives. While the racket might connote 400 horsepower to passers by, a more realistic figure would be more like 150, less than even the typical 4 cylinder family sedan has today. That suits Mr. Duvaloois: His truck weighs just 2,500 pounds, and he feels it is quick enough. He did add a later model four barrel carburetor for a bit more power. The electric choke it came with helps the engine start quicker in cold weather. Inside the original air cleaner housing, a low maintenance paper cartridge filter from a 1980s Mazda diesel pickup replaces the original's oil bath filter. \"I don't care much about speed,\" he said. \"I'm more interested in reliability and gas mileage, because I drive a lot. My '46 gets 23 miles per gallon.\" Grinning, he added: \"And if you're going too fast, people can't see how cool you look.\" For reliability, Mr. Duvaloois replaced the old style generator and weak 6 volt electrical system with a more modern alternator and 12 volt setup. The upgrades made it possible for him to install a later model Chrysler electronic ignition and an electric windshield wiper, which covers only the driver's side.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Automobiles"}
{"text": "HATTIESBURG, Miss. Scott Phillips had to close his small plumbing company after the housing bubble burst and his business dried up. Roshonda Bolton lost her job when the garment and uniform factory where she had worked for 16 years shut down last August. Hunting for work just as the nation's economy was shedding eight million jobs, they found little besides discouragement. \"I applied for everything, found nothing,\" said Ms. Bolton, 37. That finally changed when the two were hired by a paper napkin factory here last month, placing them in the vanguard of a new approach that Mississippi and a growing number of states are taking to get people working again. Their salaries will initially be paid by the State of Mississippi, which is tapping into a relatively small pot of welfare money in last year's stimulus package that can be used to subsidize jobs directly. Now they are being trained on the machines here at the Hattiesburg Paper Company, learning to turn mammoth rolls of paper into folded dinner napkins and toilet paper. The general manager, Steve Swiggum, said the state's offer to subsidize the salaries helped push the company to accelerate its hiring. \"We kind of held back a little bit in the midpart of the fall,\" he said, \"just to wait to really see what the economy was going to do.\" The debate over a new jobs bill in Congress where the Senate is considering a wavering agreement supported by the Obama administration largely centers on other approaches, like modest payroll tax breaks for businesses that hire and more spending on infrastructure. Lee Celano for The New York Times Lately, however, with the unemployment rate stubbornly hovering near 10 percent, some liberal economists have urged the Obama administration to take a more direct tack: they want the government to spend money directly to create jobs, much as it did during the New Deal. Some call it the most cost effective way for the government to create jobs. The idea has gained little traction in Washington. But on a small scale, some 21 states are already taking the direct approach, using a sliver of the 5 billion in welfare money in last year's stimulus act that can be used to pay governments and private employers to hire people. Florida recently announced that it would use up to 200 million to create thousands of jobs in the public and private sectors. Los Angeles County set itself a goal of putting 10,000 people to work with its money. Tennessee focused its initial efforts on Perry County, a small rural county where the unemployment rate rose above 25 percent after an auto parts plant closed. After Perry County paid for roughly 400 jobs, as varied as road workers and pie bakers, the unemployment rate dropped to 18 percent. But local officials worry about what will happen when the subsidies end. Here in Mississippi, state officials have come up with a novel approach that they hope will improve the chances that the jobs they create will outlast the subsidies. Labor experts say the experiment is being watched with interest by other states. The Steps program, as Mississippi calls it, focuses on private sector jobs. There are limits as to what kinds of work can qualify no strippers or bartenders need apply. And the program is set up to reduce the subsidy for each new worker over time: employers will be reimbursed for each new worker's full salary for the first two months of work, and then the monthly reimbursement will be scaled back gradually until it drops to just a quarter of the salary in the sixth month. After that, the employer must pay the full salary. Scott Phillips, who closed his small plumbing business amid the housing bust, was eventually hired by Hattiesburg Paper. Lee Celano for The New York Times The program is basically open to almost all for profit businesses and nonprofit groups, as well as public hospitals, that are in good standing with the state. To increase small business participation, officials said they were giving priority to employers with 25 employees or fewer, and barring companies where the work force has gone on strike or been locked out. No more than half of a business's work force can participate. For now, stimulus money is paying the salary of Edgar Herring, a 49 year old who lost his job of 18 years when a local lumber company shut down last fall, at his new job on the housekeeping staff at King's Daughters Medical Center in Brookhaven. It is also paying the salary of Roger Thomas, 36, who lost his job as a car salesman, at his new sales job with National Collection Systems, a locally owned waste management company in Jackson. And it is paying Johnny B. McGowan, 59, Curtis R. Williams, 43, and John McCoy, 46, to install metal studs and Sheetrock in the old Standard Life building in downtown Jackson, an Art Deco tower being converted to apartments. The challenge with subsidized work programs is to make sure that the government does not wind up paying for jobs that would have been created without public money, said Richard A. Hobbie, the chief executive officer of the National Association of State Workforce Agencies, which represents state labor departments. The last big federal subsidized jobs program, signed into law by President Richard M. Nixon, ended during the Reagan administration after critics charged that it was paying local governments for jobs they would have filled in any case. If the idea of subsidized jobs is seen as liberal in some circles, it seems to have bipartisan appeal at the state level. Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi, one of the nation's most prominent Republicans, said he saw the state's program as being in the spirit of the welfare overhaul. \"It's welfare to work,\" he said. The state can spend up to 43 million on the program, which officials estimate could create as many as 3,500 jobs the equivalent of several factory openings, but only a small dent in the problem for a state that had 133,000 unemployed residents in December. Only a few dozen workers have been hired since the program began last month after receiving federal approval.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Economy"}
{"text": "WASHINGTON At a virtual conference in September, Adam Boehler, chief executive of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, described his nascent agency as a bulwark against China's \"economic colonialism\" with 60 billion in annual lending authority to counter Beijing's strategy of spreading its global influence with low interest infrastructure loans. But in recent months, Mr. Boehler, a former health care executive, has repurposed the international agency into something far from its intended role: a financing arm for projects inside the United States. Working closely with Jared Kushner, the president's son in law and senior adviser, Mr. Boehler helped draft an executive order over the summer that, for the first time, gave the agency authority to issue loans to U.S. companies for projects on American soil. The move was billed as a way to boost President Trump's \"Buy America\" ambitions during a time of economic crisis. Now, Mr. Boehler's agency is embroiled in controversy over its first domestic loan 765 million for Kodak, which was intended to help the once iconic photography company transform into a pharmaceutical firm that could lessen America's reliance on foreign countries for generic drugs and coronavirus treatments. The Securities and Exchange Commission is probing allegations of insider trading by Kodak executives ahead of the deal's announcement, and the Development Finance Corporation's inspector general is looking into how Kodak got the loan. The funding has been put on hold and Mr. Trump, who hailed the loan as \"momentous,\" has distanced himself from the decision. The questions about the Kodak project highlight the risks inherent in the Trump administration's strategy to build American manufacturing by embracing the type of industrial policy that other nations have long employed one that the United States has traditionally avoided in favor of free markets. Mr. Trump has taken aggressive measures to prop up flagging sectors and companies, including supporting steel and aluminum by imposing global metal tariffs. He has funneled nearly 30 billion in subsidies to prop up struggling farmers who were hurt by his trade war with China. And this summer, Mr. Trump's Treasury Department gave a 700 million stimulus loan to a struggling trucking company, YRC Worldwide, under the questionable rationale that it was critical to national security. In May, the Trump administration found a new way to support domestic companies: The Development Finance Corporation. The agency had been created by Congress in 2018 to replace the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which had encouraged American companies to invest in developing countries. Congress gave the new agency 60 billion to bankroll international infrastructure projects and a mandate to coordinate more closely with the State Department on loans that, ideally, would help to curb Chinese influence and support American foreign policy. The agency has funded 80 overseas projects totaling 4.8 billion in places like Mozambique, Kenya, Colombia and Costa Rica this year. But top Trump officials had long been eyeing the agency's pot of money as a potential source of cash for domestic projects. In 2019, as Mr. Trump was seeking more funding for his wall along the Southern border with Mexico, Mr. Kushner approached Ray Washburne, who was then leading the agency as it began transitioning from the O.P.I.C. to the International Development Finance Corporation, to see if financing might be available. The company had been producing some pharmaceutical ingredients for several years and had begun making hand sanitizer and face shields since the pandemic took hold. Kodak officials told the administration that the loan would be part of a larger corporate reinvention that entailed converting vast chemical facilities once dedicated to their print business to produce raw ingredients used in pharmaceuticals. By July, after a byzantine application process, Kodak had won a \"letter of intent\" to receive government support. Administration officials saw the loan to Kodak as dual victory a way to both help restore America's factory capacity and lessen its reliance on China and India for critical drugs. In a White House briefing on July 28, Mr. Trump said the administration had taken \"a momentous step toward achieving American pharmaceutical independence\" and called it \"one of the most important deals in the history of U.S. pharmaceutical industries.\" But critics immediately questioned why Kodak could not secure financing through the capital markets and were dubious the effort would help address the immediate health crisis. \"The Kodak loan didn't seem directly relevant to the crisis that we're in,\" said Clemence Landers, policy fellow at the Center for Global Development. \"This feels like part of the administration's broader onshoring agenda.\" \"I wasn't involved in the deal,\" Mr. Trump said on Aug. 4. \"Kodak has been a great name, but obviously pretty much in a different business.\" Democrats, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have been scrutinizing Mr. Kushner's medical supply chain projects and his close ties to Mr. Boehler. They have raised suspicion that personal ties, rather than economic considerations, were the main factor in granting the International Development Finance Corporation a prominent new domestic mission. At Ms. Warren's request, the agency's inspector general is reviewing the loan process. Mr. Navarro, in an emailed comment, said that \"a key mission of the Trump administration is to bring home our medical supply chains.\" He said the White House was \"pursuing numerous projects to advance this mission, with Kodak now far in the rearview mirror.\"", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Economy"}
{"text": "WASHINGTON The World Trade Organization will grant the United States permission to impose tariffs on the European Union as part of a prolonged scuffle over subsidies given to European plane maker Airbus, European officials said Monday, a move that is likely to exacerbate trade tensions across the Atlantic. The ruling, to be published in the week of Sept. 30, is the global trade body's final decision in a 15 year old dispute over the government assistance that Europe provides to its major plane manufacturer. It will clear the way for the United States to impose tariffs on European goods, worsening tensions that have become strained under President Trump's confrontational approach. The W.T.O. still must authorize a specific dollar amount that the United States can recoup through tariffs. But the United States Trade Representative has already prepared two lists of up to 25 billion worth of products that it can tax, including airplanes, fish, wine, leather purses, carpets and clocks. The trade body opened the door for the Trump administration to impose billions of dollars in retaliatory sanctions last May, when it ruled that Europe had illegally subsidized Airbus to the detriment of its American competitor Boeing. The ruling could become fodder for Mr. Trump's growing trade fight with the European Union, which he has accused of weakening its currency and criticized for exporting more goods into the United States than it buys. In retaliation for the harm Europe's trade actions have caused the American economy, the United States is proposing putting tariffs on a wide variety of European products, including helicopters, airplane fuselages, Parmesan cheese, olives, wine, handbags, sweaters, glassware, clocks, Irish and Scotch whisky, and copper alloys. The United States Trade Representative held hearings in May and August to allow companies and groups that might be affected by the tariffs to plead their case, and the final list could change. The Trade Representative is expected to release the final list after the World Trade Organization announces its official decision. Mr. Trump has already rankled European leaders by imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and threatening to tax European automobiles before the end of the year. His administration's attempt to negotiate a trade deal with the bloc has also faltered as the two sides continue to disagree about which industries, like agriculture, should be included in any deal. The Airbus ruling threatens to set off a tit for tat tariff exchange between the two major trading partners that may further weigh on trans Atlantic business and global economic growth. The W.T.O. is also considering a parallel case that the European Union has brought against the United States for providing subsidies to American plane maker Boeing. The E.U. claims that the United States provided 20 billion in illegal subsidies to the American plane maker, including through Washington state tax breaks. A decision in that case is expected early next year and could authorize European retaliation against the United States. Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles. Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters. Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. The E.U. has already drawn up its own list of 20 billion of American imports it plans to tax after the Boeing ruling is announced, including aircraft, food and chemicals. Speaking in Brussels on Monday, Cecilia Malmstrom, the outgoing European commissioner for trade, said the E.U. had tried to negotiate a way out of retaliatory tariffs in response to both the Airbus and Boeing rulings, but that the United States had not responded to these requests. Ms. Malmstrom told reporters in Brussels on Monday that she had approached American officials \"long before this summer\" to discuss a resolution to the tariff spat. \"It's not that they said 'no,' it's that they have not engaged on this, and we have provided them paper and proposals and so on,\" she said. \"We would propose that we both freeze or suspend our tariffs while we talk, until we come to an agreement, and that remains to be seen.\" She added that both governments \"need to discipline our air industries\" and work to reform subsidies. \"And it would be good to do that together,\" she added. \"It is sometimes a little bit hard to predict the next step by the U.S. administration,\" Ms. Malmstrom said. Ms. Malmstrom also said Monday that negotiations on a free trade agreement with the United States had stalled. American officials want agricultural goods to be included in any trade discussion, saying that a deal that excludes farm goods would be unlikely to be approved by Congress. The European Union has refused to put agriculture on the table and pushed for the pact to cover industries where the two governments already agree, namely non auto industrial goods. European officials had hoped for a fresh start with the United States earlier this month, after a positive visit by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Brussels on Sept. 2. Ms. Malmstrom said Monday that Gordon Sondland, the American ambassador to the European Union, had told her that the United States wanted to \"restart\" their relationship with the European Union. But imposing tariffs on aircraft could make any resolution more difficult. The Trump administration has already levied a 10 percent tariff on aluminum and 25 percent tariff on steel from the European Union, and it is scheduled to make another decision about whether to impose tariffs on cars imported from Europe and elsewhere in November, taxes that could be devastating to major auto exporters like Germany. Mr. Trump decided in May to postpone those levies for six months, arguing that his administration wanted to see how trade talks with Europe progressed. The administration has cited national security as justification for the metal and auto tariffs, saying that imports have degraded the American industrial base, putting the country's ability to supply critical goods and technology to the military at risk. That rationale has been controversial, and many critics argue that the tariffs violate the W.T.O.'s international trade rules. New tariffs as a result of the Airbus case would be different, in that they will be undertaken with the World Trade Organization's permission. The organization allows its members to levy tariffs on each other to recoup trade losses when it finds a country has broken its trade rules. Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute, said that tariffs on European exports in response to the Airbus decision would be very different legally from the tariffs on European steel and aluminum, though \"neither is a good economic idea,\" he said. \"In the Airbus case, the U.S. is imposing tariffs only after it went through all of the W.T.O.'s legal steps proving its case and getting an official ruling and only after Europe was asked and refused to comply,\" he said.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Economy"}
{"text": "Not since the invention of penicillin, or maybe even Play Doh, has an accidental discovery been as epic as the revelation that the Academy Awards show doesn't need a host. Just visualize it: No host. O.K., not a great visual but it's only TV. Blind luck has often played a role in world changing breakthroughs and, in the case of the Non Hosted Oscars, blind luck drizzled with bad taste, bad vetting, bad foresight, bad values, pitiless social media and widespread early onset flop sweat, added up to a delightfully obvious remedy to a 91 year old problem: The Academy Awards as drying paint. Now, with momentum at its back, the academy should ride its sudden wave of innovation. With a few more newfangled tweaks, the Academy Awards telecast can someday be right there on the cutting edge of passe. Which brings us to the other fangle that the academy should consider: the No Thanks Amendment, in which Oscar winners are forbidden to thank anyone. Unlike most new laws, grasping the rationale behind this prohibition requires insight as unexceptional as the no host verdict. First: The typical, lifelong Academy Awards show viewer a demographic couched somewhere between Lipitor and Synthroid has lost roughly three weeks of life to the phrase \"I would like to thank ...\" These viewers deserve to be made whole. They are the people who still watch movies in theaters. They read reviews written by people paid to be film critics. They know who Irving Thalberg was and vaguely who Kevin Hart is. They are even savvy enough to find it refreshing if, say, a makeup artist accepts an Oscar and says: \"The truth is, this film was not a total team effort. My work with facial toner is all that saved this project from complete disaster.\" Traditionally, after saying, \"I would like to thank ...\" Oscar winners mention 10 to 50 names. Unfortunately, American viewers tend to have little awareness of anonymous people. There are at most six documented cases of a Michigander saying, \"Oh, she's repped by Ben Anderson at C.A.A. Now it all makes sense.\" Hence, in the unlikely event Emma Stone ever needed help in her career, the No Thanks Amendment would compel her to thank her agent at the valet stand. Or at the Vanity Fair after party. Or over the phone months later. After thanking their professional hangers on, winners thank spouses, parents and children. In an industry at demonstrable odds with most family values, such gratitude rings hollow and stupefyingly meh. Sure, there are instances when something super fun occurs during these moments like when Hilary Swank thanked everyone on two coasts except her husband but such anomalies hardly offset a thousand hours of \"All right, enough already.\" Home, or ski home or Martha's Vineyard home or Malibu home is where the heart is. Families thanked at all four will most likely get over their nationally televised snub. Finally, there's the ultimate in pointless gratitude: \"I would like to thank the academy.\" A) Just because you \"would like to\" do something, doesn't mean you have to. B) It's quite possible you would be thanking a body in which only half the voters chose you. In fact, with potentially 10 best picture nominees, Oscar winners could wind up expressing heartfelt gratitude to seven of 10 people who didn't like their film in the least. Note to academy: Go back to five best picture nominees. This is an Oscar, not a participation trophy. What was \"an honor to just be nominated\" is now \"a slap in the face\" not to be nominated. C) In thanking the academy, you don't know who you're thanking. We all get academy screeners that we illegally mail out to relatives in other cities. But who are these people who actually vote? No one knows. Rumors of a Hollywood skin deep state crop up but go unconfirmed. Someday the truth will emerge. In the meantime, unless an Oscar winner is so richly undeserving (oh, say, \"The Artist\" as best picture, 2012) that the academy deserves thanks purely for its horrific taste, we can toss this bit of obligatory politeness out with the others. O.K., that's the broad strokes of the No Thanks Amendment. Not bad, huh? Well, in fairness, there is a potential downside. Judging from scattered reports that reach Los Angeles, America is going through troubled times, and movie people tend to take all forms of injustice more personally than those victimized. With the No Thanks Amendment freeing up much of the 45 seconds allotted for acceptance speeches, political speechifying could become highly oppressive, possibly polarizing and certainly incoherent. Consider the idea of enclosing in the winner's envelope a list of three issues affecting our nation from which the Oscar recipient must either choose one to spout off on or none. Oscar winners, accustomed to working off a script may very well choose none, then have little else to say before leaving the stage. And really, isn't that the dream? In fact (oh my God!) here's another brilliant innovation: If you win an Oscar and simply grab your statuette and walk offstage without saying a word, you get one past violation of political correctness expunged from your record and 10 percent off the 30,000 fee for your star on the Walk of Fame. Wow, beyond mere progress being made, we could be inching toward a revolution. A revolution that will be televised. And draw incredibly modest ratings.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Movies"}
{"text": "LONDON This year's Oscar nominations have generated little controversy, with one exception: \"Detainment,\" named in the best live action short category, an accolade that has offended many in Britain. On Wednesday, The Daily Mirror called the film's nomination an \"Oscars insult.\" \"'Hang your head in shame, Hollywood ... this is off limits,'\" read a headline in the tabloid newspaper. An online petition calling for \"Detainment\" to be removed from the nominations, had attracted over 150,000 signatures by Friday. Opinion pieces and radio programs have debated the film extensively. The 30 minute movie caused such a stir because it is about one of Britain's most notorious and troubling crimes. In 1993, Jon Venables and Robert Thompson were convicted of murdering James Bulger. The killers were just 10 years old at the time; James was only 2. The images of Venables and Thompson leading James from a mall while his mother was distracted captured on security cameras and widely shown on TV news at the time are seared in many people's memory here. The pair walked James several miles before torturing and murdering him with, among other things, bricks and a metal bar, the police investigation and the boys' testimonies revealed. They left his body on a railway line. When they were released from prison in 2001, Venables and Thompson were granted lifelong anonymity. Still, the decades old case keeps being revisited: Venables, now 36, was jailed in 2010 for possession of child pornography, and was charged with the same offense last year, prompting the case to be revisited. There have also been attempts, both legal and amateur, to reveal the pair's new identities. A court order that applies worldwide prevents anyone publishing images that claim to identify them. The Bulger killing has already been the subject of a play, which also caused complaints in Britain's tabloids, as well as numerous books. But none have caused such an outcry as \"Detainment,\" which has been accused of humanizing or being sympathetic to the killers, even though only its trailer and a few short clips can be seen online. \"Detainment\" has won awards, including a special jury prize at Cannes, but it started to attract criticism in Britain after it was nominated for an Oscar. This month, Denise Fergus, James Bulger's mother, called for the film to be pulled from the Oscars and complained that the family was not consulted about it. \"It's one thing making a film like this without contacting or getting permission from James family, but another to have a child re enact the final hours of James's life before he was brutally murdered and making myself and my family have to relive this all over again,\" Fergus said in a statement posted on Twitter on Tuesday. Albert Kirby, the detective who led the investigation into the killing, told the BBC that the events shown in the film were accurate, but still called for its withdrawal from consideration. \"It's causing so much unnecessary upset,\" he said. The 38 year old Irish director Vincent Lambe said in a telephone interview that in 2012 he started researching the murder, which also dominated the news in Dublin during his childhood. \"I wanted to try and understand what could have led two 10 year old boys to have done this,\" he said. There has never been a proper debate about why the killing happened, despite its prominence, he added. He considered contacting the families involved, he said, but decided it could harm the film. \"We wanted to make a film that was factual and impartial,\" he said. \"I think if we did contact them there'd be pressure to tell it the way they wanted it to be told.\" \"We never meant any disrespect,\" he added. \"I hope people can see it with an open mind,\" he said, \"but that might not be possible now.\" In a statement, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which organizes the Oscars, said in part: \"The academy offers its deepest condolences to Ms. Fergus and her family. We are deeply moved and saddened by the loss that they have endured, and we take their concerns very seriously.\" Carter Pilcher, the president of ShortsTV, which distributes the nominated short films to theaters, is a voting member of the academy. In a telephone interview, he said that he did not expect the film to be dropped. \"The academy can't be in the place of deciding which stories can be told,\" he said. There have been similar protests in the shorts category before, Pilcher added. Last year, with the MeToo movement at its height, pressure mounted to remove Kobe Bryant's short film \"Dear Basketball\" from the running, because he had been accused of rape in 2003. Bryant won best animated short. Pilcher added he had sympathy for the Bulger family, but felt \"Detainment\" was deserving of its nomination. \"I think it's a very well made film,\" he said. \"It certainly puts these questions in front of you,\" he added. \"If you're 10, how can you do something like this?\"", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Movies"}
{"text": "Having sold out at event screenings since December, \"They Shall Not Grow Old,\" which opens for a full run this week, is poised to become the only blockbuster this year that was filmed from 1914 to 1918, on location on the Western Front. Commissioned to make a movie for the centennial of the Armistice, using original footage, Peter Jackson has taken a mass of World War I archival clips from Britain's Imperial War Museum and fashioned it into a brisk, absorbing and moving experience. How he has done this is simultaneously novel and destined to earn the justifiable quibbling of purists. Although the film is book ended by black and white footage of men going off to war and then returning home, the battlefield sequences have been substantially doctored, with the ostensible goal of making them more immersive and appealing to modern audiences. Given how few films from the 1910s are showing in multiplexes, the intent is at least arguably noble, although you wonder how Jackson would feel about his \"Lord of the Rings\" being tinkered with 100 years after its making. Jackson has adjusted the frame rates (the speed at which a film is projected, which wasn't standardized until the sound era); added color in ways said to comport with the actual hues of uniforms and landscapes; given the film a 3 D conversion that can be seen in select theaters; and dubbed in voices for the soldiers, with the aid of forensic lip readers employed to figure out what they were saying.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Movies"}
{"text": "Regulators on four continents are preparing for a long awaited showdown with Facebook, after years of disinterest and half steps. They largely have the same goal: changing the social media company's behavior. Figuring out how is the hard part. Members of the Federal Trade Commission in the United States are weighing what sorts of constraints they would put on Facebook's business practices. But there is not agreement on those terms within the F.T.C., according to two people familiar with the internal talks who were not allowed to discuss them publicly. Facebook said this week that it expected that the agency would impose a fine of 3 billion to 5 billion for violations of a privacy settlement from 2011. It would be the highest penalty in the United States against a tech company. The company and F.T.C. officials have discussed additional mandates that would constrain how Facebook's handles data, strengthens security and monitors its privacy practices, according to the two people familiar with the discussions. Joseph J. Simons, the F.T.C. chairman, has been determined to get consensus from the five member commission and is facing resistance on the proposed settlement from within the agency, according to the people. The potential settlement is seen as a landmark privacy decision and a referendum on the nation's ability to police the powers of Big Tech and protect consumers. The conditions on a deal with Facebook would have far reaching impact, setting standards for future privacy violations and influencing the creation of privacy regulations in the United States and other countries, legal experts say. \"It will set the bar,\" said David C. Vladeck, former head of consumer protection at the F.T.C. \"Once the F.T.C. creates a consent order, it levels the playing field so that any other party that engages in the same behavior will have every expectation that the prior order will apply to them.\" In Europe, officials in Britain, France, Germany and Ireland are scrutinizing the social media company's practices. Governments in Australia, India, New Zealand and Singapore have passed or are considering new restrictions on social media. Facebook has shown its willingness to fight charges of privacy violations. On Thursday, Facebook disputed findings by Canada's privacy commissioners in an investigation into how Cambridge Analytica, a British political consulting firm that worked for the Trump presidential campaign, gained access to information about Facebook users. The privacy commissioner of Canada and the information and privacy commissioner for British Columbia said Facebook violated national and local laws in allowing third parties access to private user information through \"superficial and ineffective safeguards and consent mechanisms.\" The Canadian regulators, who have limited power to force Facebook's compliance, plan to take the company to a Canadian federal court. The court, which focuses on regulatory issues and lawsuits against the government, may impose fines. The revelations of data misuse by Cambridge Analytica also set off the investigation at the F.T.C. But regulators expanded it to include other privacy violations by Facebook that were reported, almost monthly, according to a person familiar with the investigation. Among conditions that are being discussed by the F.T.C. are stronger monitoring of Facebook's privacy practices and greater restraints on how the company shares data with third parties, according to the two people familiar with the discussions. But the conditions are not finalized and could change, as could the amount of the fine, which Facebook said was a projection. The agency and Facebook could decide to go to court over charges if an agreement is not reached. The two sides were close to concluding settlement talks earlier this month, according to a person familiar with the talks. The company's guidance to investors of the financial penalty also indicated a conclusion is near. But disagreements over final terms of a settlement have complicated the conclusion of the F.T.C.'s one year investigation. At least one member of the five person commission has called for direct punishment of Facebook's chief, Mark Zuckerberg, and believes the proposed fine would not change Facebook's behavior, the people said. In fact, the member would be willing to fight in court for stronger controls over the company, the two people said. Agency officials are determined to keep the discussions with Facebook private, and the F.T.C.'s inspector general has started an investigation into leaks of the talks, according to a person familiar with the investigation. Also on Thursday, the New York attorney general's office said it was investigating how Facebook gained access to the email address books of more than 1.5 million users without permission. Facebook is already fighting a lawsuit by the attorney general of Washington, D.C., Karl Racine, for the misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica. Immediately after Facebook's announcement of the projected fine, Democratic lawmakers and privacy advocates said the punishment was too weak. Marc Rotenberg, president of the nonprofit privacy group EPIC, said a large fine was an insufficient solution to Facebook's repeated privacy violations. He and others have called for constraints on the structure of Facebook's business. Mr. Zuckerberg has come out in support of global privacy and content regulations, joining a growing chorus of tech chief executives who now hope to shape federal and global regulations for the internet. \"The real challenge facing the F.T.C. right now is whether to allow Facebook to integrate WhatsApp and Instagram with Messenger,\" Mr. Rotenberg said. \"The commission has the opportunity because of the pending enforcement action to stop that. If they don't, Facebook's dominance of the internet economy will only increase.\" Dipayan Ghosh, a former economic adviser on tech issues during the Obama administration, said the conditions laid out in the F.T.C. order would also guide federal legislation. \"Enforcement actions have a broad impact on the entire industry. They can set norms,\" Mr. Ghosh said. The F.T.C. action foreshadows problems for Facebook across the Atlantic, where European regulators have sharply criticized the social media giant's handling of user data, harmful influence on elections and vulnerability to the spread of extremist ideologies. In Ireland, home to Facebook's European headquarters, the company is facing several investigations into whether it is complying with European data protection laws. Just this week, the Irish Data Protection Commission started a fresh inquiry into Facebook exposing user passwords. Under European privacy law, Facebook could be fined up to 4 percent of global revenue, or about 2.23 billion. British authorities last year gave Facebook the maximum possible fine of 500,000 pounds, worth about 645,000, for allowing Cambridge Analytica to harvest the information of millions of users without their consent. The country is also considering naming a new internet regulator who could issue fines and hold individual executives legally liable for harmful content spread on their platforms. In France, where the government has passed laws to stop the spread of misinformation on social media close to elections, officials are investigating Facebook's content moderation policies. And in Germany, which adopted an anti hate speech law that requires Facebook to screen out posts considered harmful, antitrust authorities forced Facebook to adjust its data collection policies after determining the company was exploiting its market dominance to profile its users and sell advertising. The efforts are part of a broader effort to clamp down on social media around the world. Ben Scott, a former State Department official in the Obama administration, said the global scrutiny represented \"a massive wave of outrage that will crash straight into the central premise of the company's business model.\"", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Technology"}
{"text": "WASHINGTON When it comes to regulating Facebook, Congress is in over its head. But does that matter? This week's marathon testimony by Mark Zuckerberg, the social network's chief executive, revealed the limited understanding many lawmakers have of what Facebook is and how it works. Members of Congress came with a mixed bag of concerns for Mr. Zuckerberg, including a few incisive points about Facebook's privacy and data collection policies and a lot of off topic ramblings about how computers work, but these questions never amounted to a unified theory of Facebook's troubles, or suggestions of how they might be solved. It's tempting to claim that technological illiteracy is the problem that some older and tech phobic lawmakers are fundamentally incapable of regulating Facebook properly. But I want to suggest another takeaway. The biggest obstacle to regulating Facebook is not Congress's lack of computer literacy, which gave Mr. Zuckerberg the upper hand this week. It's a lack of political will, and an unwillingness to identify the problems they're trying to fix in the first place. After all, Congress typically does not require subject matter expertise of its members. Most politicians in Washington did not understand the complexities of mortgage backed securities in 2009, when Wall Street executives testified in the wake of the financial crisis. The lawmakers also are not pharmaceutical experts, or transportation policy wonks or deeply knowledgeable in many of the other complex issues that come before them. And yet, Congress with the help of staff experts and outside advisers has managed to pass sweeping legislation to prevent excesses and bad behavior in those sectors. \"It's never an issue of the members being able to do it their staff is often incredibly dedicated and can dig into these issues,\" said Ashkan Soltani, a former chief technologist at the Federal Trade Commission. The challenge, Mr. Soltani said, is that there's a \"lost in translation\" problem of trying to condense complex, multifaceted issues into easily digested sound bites that will play well with constituents. Members of the Energy and Commerce Committee pressed Facebook's chief executive on data privacy, security and political bias on the social media platform. \"You and your co founders started a company in your dorm room that's grown to be one of the biggest and most successful businesses in the entire world. While Facebook has certainly grown, I worry it may not have matured. I think it's time to ask whether Facebook may have moved too fast and broken too many things.\" \"Who do you think owns an individual's presence online? Who owns their virtual you? Is it you or is it them?\" \"Congresswoman, I believe that everyone owns their own content online. And that's the first line of our terms of service, if you read it, says that.\" \"After this new algorithm was implemented, that there was a tremendous bias against conservative news and content and a favorable bias towards liberal content. Was there a directive to put a bias in and first are you aware of this bias that many people have looked at and analyzed and seen?\" \" Congressman, this is a really important question. There is absolutely no directive in any of the changes that we make to have a bias in anything that we do.\" \"Well, you have a long history of growth and success. But you also have a long list of apologies. In 2003, it started at Harvard. 'I apologize for any harm done as a result of my neglect.' 2006: 'We really messed this one up.' 2007: 'We simply did a bad job. I apologize for it.' This is proof to me that self regulation simply does not work.\" \"Are you aware of other third party information mishandlings that have not been disclosed?\" \"Congresswoman, no, although we are currently going through the process of investigating every single app \" \"So you're not sure?\" that had access to a large amount of data.\" \"All right, but I only have four minutes. Was your data included in the data sold to the malicious third parties? Your personal data?\" \"Yes.\" \"If you don't, you're not listening to us on the phone, who is, and do you have specific contracts with these companies that will provide data that is being acquired verbally through our phones or now through things like Alexa or other products?\" \"Congressman, we're not collecting any information verbally on the microphone, and we don't have contracts with anyone else who is.\" \"Facebook has detailed profiles on people who have never signed up for Facebook. Yes or no?\" \"Congressman, in general, we collect data from people have not signed up for Facebook for security purposes to prevent the kind of scraping that you were just referring to.\" \"As C.E.O., you didn't know some key facts. You didn't know about major court cases regarding your privacy policies against your company. You didn't know that the F.T.C. doesn't have fining authority and that Facebook could not that have received fines for the 2011 consent order. You didn't know what a shadow profile was.\" Members of the Energy and Commerce Committee pressed Facebook's chief executive on data privacy, security and political bias on the social media platform. \"This isn't just about news,\" Mr. Soltani said of Facebook's issues. \"It's not just about privacy and commercialization, it's not just about political speech. It's all of those things and more.\" If Congress wants to rein in Facebook's enormous power and the questions lawmakers asked left little doubt that it does then the first step is identifying what, specifically, they think is wrong with Facebook. Is it that Facebook is too cavalier about sharing user data with outside organizations? Is it that Facebook collects too much data about users in the first place? Is it that Facebook is promoting addictive messaging products to children? Is it that Facebook's news feed is polarizing society, pushing people to ideological fringes? Is it that Facebook is too easy for political operatives to exploit, or that it does not do enough to keep false news and hate speech off users' feeds? Is it that Facebook is simply too big, or a monopoly that needs to be broken up? All of these are concerns lawmakers brought up during this week's hearings, and they would all require different and narrowly tailored regulatory solutions. For example, Congress's goal may be to stop outside companies from getting access to people's Facebook data avoiding another scandal like the one involving Cambridge Analytica, the political consulting firm that improperly obtained data on up to 87 million Facebook users. Lawmakers could propose a bill that would prevent large social media platforms from opening themselves up to outside developers. (They should note, though, that Facebook has already limited the data available to outside companies, so this would not necessarily have the intended effect.) Congress could address the issue of data collection by adopting European style data protection policies, requiring stronger user controls for personal information or requiring social networks to delete certain types of user data automatically after a given time. If it wanted to, Congress could address the issue of hateful content by adopting strict hate speech laws like the ones that exist in Germany, which make social platforms liable if they fail to remove hate speech in a timely manner. It could address the problem of transparency in political ads by passing the Honest Ads Act, a bill that would subject online political ads to similar disclosure standards as TV and radio political ads. (Mr. Zuckerberg has already indicated that he supports the measure, so this should be an easy one.) Or, if it decides that Facebook is just too darn big, Congress could spearhead an effort to break it up. All of these are theoretically possible outcomes, depending on which of Facebook's many issues lawmakers decide to address. Lawmakers do not need to be computer scientists, or to come up with an omnibus bill to address all of Facebook's flaws in one fell swoop. It could pick off one issue at a time, consult with the experts and take a piecemeal approach. But first, it needs to understand which pieces need fixing, and how to carry out fixes without creating unintended consequences. And it needs to demonstrate that it has the political resolve to push these changes through, even as the tech industry furiously lobbies against them, as it undoubtedly will. Perhaps the most dispiriting exchange all week was when Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, asked Mr. Zuckerberg about Facebook's market power, and the notion that it is too dominant for any other social network to compete with. \"Is there an alternative to Facebook in the private sector?\" Mr. Graham asked. Mr. Zuckerberg dodged the question, saying that people use lots of apps to communicate. \"You don't feel like you have a monopoly?\" Mr. Graham wondered. \"It certainly doesn't feel that way to me,\" Mr. Zuckerberg said. By raising the issue of Facebook's lack of competition, Mr. Graham was circling around an important point. Facebook has, indeed, taken steps to acquire or crush multiple apps that have posed a competitive threat. It even runs a service called Onavo, which allows it to keep tabs on which other apps its users are using and functions as a kind of early warning system for possible competitors. But when it came time to draw the conclusion his questions had been leading to that Facebook's primary problem was its size, and that regulation should address its anticompetitive tendencies Mr. Graham pulled his punches, even asking Mr. Zuckerberg for advice about regulating his own company. \"Would you work with us in terms of what regulations you think are necessary in your industry?\" Mr. Graham asked. This week's hearings proved that a groundswell of support is building on Capitol Hill to regulate Facebook and other internet companies. But until Congress stops asking these companies how they want to be regulated and starts making its own decisions about what problems it wants to fix, its targets will continue to slip through its fingers.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Technology"}
{"text": "Uber Is Said to File for an I.P.O. as It Races Lyft to a Public Debut SAN FRANCISCO Uber confidentially filed paperwork on Thursday to go public, according to two people with knowledge of the matter, officially moving toward what is expected to be one of the biggest and most anticipated tech company stock market debuts ever. The ride hailing company filed its paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the same day that its rival Lyft also filed for an offering, said the people, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Each company is rushing to beat the other to the public markets in the first half of next year amid a fair climate for technology I.P.O.s and worries of a potential economic recession. Uber and Lyft declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that Uber had filed its public offering documents. Uber, the world's biggest ride hailing company, has been told by investment bankers that it could be worth as much as 120 billion in an I.P.O. At that valuation, it would be the biggest offering since the Alibaba Group of China began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014. It would dwarf the market capitalization of more established companies such as Goldman Sachs, putting it at around the same value as I.B.M. or McDonald's. And it would likely bring enormous windfalls for many of its investors, founders and employees. It would also be a steep jump in what private investors thought Uber was worth. In August, when Toyota made a 500 million investment in Uber, the company was valued at 76 billion. Uber and Lyft are expected to presage a wave of I.P.O.s by other tech start ups, many of which have delayed going public for years because of the plentiful availability of private capital. But as these companies mature and their early investors push to cash out their stakes, many are readying for their stock market debuts. Airbnb, the online room rental company, is among those that have made little secret that they are also preparing to become public companies. Slack, a workplace collaboration software company valued at 7.1 billion, recently hired Goldman Sachs to lead its I.P.O., said a person with knowledge of the plans. Slack declined to comment about hiring Goldman, which was reported earlier by Reuters. \"It is like the graduation. The adolescents have become adults,\" said Mamoon Hamid, a venture capitalist at Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers. \"The longest bull run in history is now culminating with a whole slew of I.P.O.s.\" He added, \"Uber is in the same ballpark as Facebook and Google.\" Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have submitted proposals to take Uber public. Lyft, which was last valued by private market investors at 15 billion, recently picked JPMorgan Chase to lead its I.P.O. Yet Uber faces a huge hurdle as it aims to go public: It is deeply unprofitable. Uber said last month that it lost 1.07 billion in the third quarter. As a privately held company, Uber is not obligated to report its earnings, but it has made a habit of doing so. Ride hailing where people hail rides through their smartphone and drivers with their own cars supply the rides is an inherently expensive business because the company has to pay to recruit drivers, expand in new markets and beat back rivals. Uber's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, has focused on paring back the unprofitable segments of the company's business. He has sold off its operations in Russia and Southeast Asia, where it faced heavy competition from local rivals, while expanding into potential new businesses like food delivery and bike and scooter rentals. Wall Street investors and others are still expected to snap up Uber's stock because it is growing quickly in a consolidating stock market with fewer I.P.O.s. Uber's executives have said it is profitable in cities where it has operated the longest, but chooses to burn money on increasing revenue faster. \"Revenue growth is significantly more important than worrying about the bottom line at this point,\" said Barrett Daniels, a partner at Deloitte who advises on I.P.O.s. Uber began as a ride hailing service for upscale clientele in 2009, the pipe dream of Garrett Camp, an entrepreneur who eventually tapped a friend, Travis Kalanick, to run the company. They quickly pushed the service into numerous cities with little regard for local laws, causing tension with established taxi companies, lawmakers and regulators. As competitors like Lyft appeared, both rushed to compete for smaller fares. The rivals have since spent billions of dollars on fare subsidies to attract people to their platforms. Passengers loved Uber's convenience and embraced it in cities such as San Francisco, New York and London. Uber now operates in more than 600 cities across 63 countries, providing more than 15 million trips a day. Venture capitalists and other investors, seizing on Uber's rapid growth, shoveled billions of dollars into the company to help it dominate. The company's investors include the venture capital firm Benchmark, First Round Capital, TPG, SoftBank, Toyota and Fidelity Investments. Many of them are set to reap big returns from an I.P.O. \"Uber's stock is widely distributed, and it will transform the lives of many thousands of families who have worked hard for this outcome,\" said Matt Ocko, a venture capitalist who invested in Uber when it was a young company. Many Uber employees will go on to start other companies, he said. \"This 'virtuous cycle' is still a big part of what makes the Valley great,\" he added. Over time, Uber branched out into different areas, like food and retail delivery, e bike and scooter rentals, trucking and freight management and autonomous vehicles even trying to build flying automobiles. Some of these efforts have run into difficulties, including earlier this year when an Uber driverless car killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Ariz. Uber underwent a rocky 2017 when its workplace culture faced scrutiny for sexual harassment and for putting growth above all other considerations. Mr. Kalanick was ousted in June 2017 after shareholders staged a revolt against him. Mr. Khosrowshahi was appointed Uber's chief executive a few months later. He has vowed to improve the company's culture and mend broken relationships with regulators, lawmakers and others. Uber's backers are eager to put last year's troubles behind them. \"I know Dara has the full trust of investors and employees, and we are confident he knows what he's doing,\" said Chris Sacca, an early investor in the company. \"We're not done by any means, but if you look at where we were one year ago, we were dealing with fundamental issues of governance, of board alignment, of these continuing battles amongst power brokers on our board and whether or not we were going to have SoftBank with us or against us,\" Mr. Khosrowshahi said in an interview with The New York Times earlier this year. \"Those were very important issues to deal with and to resolve, and I think we resolved them quite effectively in a positive way.\"", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Technology"}
{"text": "People of all ages fell for the cute gnome like alien at the center of Steven Spielberg's 1982 movie \"E.T. the Extra Terrestrial.\" But some fell extra hard; Katherine Bernhardt, who turned 7 the year the movie premiered, was smitten enough to paint portraits of E.T. in art school. In her latest show, \"Done with Xanax,\" she returns to him, pushing her distinctive fusion of Pop Art, Color Field and graffiti toward a more vulnerable, narrative expression and more complex painting process. Ms. Bernhardt has at times seemed stuck in her signature patterns formed by repeating images of popular commodities and motifs cigarettes, sharks, cellphones, slices of fruit and floating emojis on expanses of bright color. She has painted fictional figures like the Pink Panther, Babar the Elephant and Garfield, but E.T. is more dimensional, complicated by a kind of saintliness, otherness and conflict: He is a stranger in an inhospitable land who has healing powers and wants to go home. Ms. Bernhardt renders E.T. single and large, like an icon, often outlined in gold or silver spray paint and frequently raising his glowing forefinger in benediction. She evokes but also takes liberties with moments from the movie, making them vaguely recognizable in the way that scenes from the Bible can be. For example, the paintings \"Halloween in California\" and \"Halloween E.T. Strawberries\" show the extraterrestrial wearing the blond wig from the dress up session in Gertie's bedroom and a patterned muumuu that suggests suburban California of a certain era. In others, he's famously aloft, in the basket of Elliott's bicycle, or surrounded by push button telephones reflecting his oft stated desire to \"Phone home!\" Especially good is \"Sick,\" where E.T. is shrouded in a brilliantly white blanket that is unpainted canvas. It symbolizes the way Ms. Bernhardt has opened up her work and her style. Hopefully, her progress will continue. Last year, Michael Rakowitz got more attention for his protests than his participation in New York museums. He was the first artist to withdraw from the 2019 Whitney Biennial, providing a template for others whose departures eventually helped drive a tear gas magnate from the museum's board; later, in a move aimed at a board member of the Museum of Modern Art, Mr. Rakowitz tried to pause his own video work from a show at its sister institution, PS1. Mr. Rakowitz's current show at Lombard, at least, lets us assess his work on its own terms. Here the Chicago based artist is showing the latest chapter in an ongoing project, \"The Invisible Enemy Should Not Exist,\" which reconstructs looted or destroyed Iraqi antiquities out of humble materials. An earlier exhibition focused on objects stolen from Baghdad's National Museum; here, he and a team have remade reliefs of an Assyrian palace that was blasted by the Islamic State out of packets of mixed herbs, newspapers and other scraps from the regional economy. I suppose the colorful reliefs have a baleful relevance for those of us already incensed by the cultural (and human) devastation of Iraq. But they are also rehearsed and self contained, and that goes double for \"The Ballad of Special Ops Cody,\" a haughty work of stop motion animation filmed at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, which depicts a U.S. Army toy figurine inspecting the museum's Near Eastern collection while a voice over recounts various lootings and atrocities. Mr. Rakowitz is better when he pushes his historical and political engagement into generosity, as he did in his moving \"Return,\" his contested video at PS1, which allegorizes the Iraq war and refugee crisis through his red tape choked efforts to import Iraqi dates to Brooklyn. The life altering peculiarities of the American immigration system collide, in Hunter East Harlem Gallery's group show \"The Extraordinary,\" with the slippery problem of defining artistic success. The show, curated by Arden Sherman with Nora Maite Nieves, began with an open call to artists who had or were pursuing the O 1 visa for extraordinary ability: Promising works by Yue Nakayama, Woomin Kim, Shimpei Shirafuji, Firoz Mahmud, Catalina Tuca, Anna Parisi and Sarah Mihara Creagen might earn them permission to live and work temporarily in the United States, or renew the permission they already have, if their inclusion in the show helps persuade the immigration service that they're renowned in their field. Ms. Nakayama's video of child actors performing incongruous monologues is strangely fascinating, as are the tabletop \"minerals\" that Ms. Kim makes from everyday materials like colored chalk or acrylic nails. But the show's distinct highlight is a short narrative video, \"The Challenges of Imagination,\" made by the Iranian artist Ramyar Vala, who has an O 1 visa with no re entry stamp, with his older brother Rambod, whose O 1 was rejected. The only piece to treat the show's premise explicitly, the video includes amazing real life details like an immigration officer pointing out to Ramyar Vala that he's not as famous as Jeff Koons. But it's equally a critique of the art world itself, which can be just as blithe about treating market success as a proxy for inherent merit. As an Iranian exile, Mr. Vala would clearly find the most success here by making work about his situation but what if he wants to make work about something else? The video's last scene, which captures Rambod Vala in the tub, eating Haagen Dazs and singing along to Lou Reed's song \"Perfect Day,\" is an exhilarating rebuke to the very notion of success. What if Max Beckmann had made a painting about illegal abortion? He might have produced something like Juanita McNeely's 1969 \"Is It Real? Yes It Is,\" a magnificent nine panel installation showing now at James Fuentes Gallery in collaboration with Mitchell Algus. A squatting skeleton, pinioned women with buckled knees and crows picking the flesh from a prone female body are all rendered with Beckmann's crashing color scheme and Expressionist urgency. But they don't come across as allegories they look like facts. In the central canvas, a hand holding glittering silver forceps reaches toward a woman's naked crotch under an oversize Donald Duck toy. Altogether it's a searing evocation of the fractured way we remember traumatic experiences and of the many bloody realities most people prefer not to look at. In 1985, after an accident put Ms. McNeely in a wheelchair, a doctor told her she'd never make another large painting. She responded with \"Triskaidekaptych,\" which comprises 13 substantial canvases parading edge to edge around two full walls of the gallery. Contorted female figures are still here, along with torture, medical horror and a screaming baboon's face. But the introduction of softer blues and pinks, and of a cloudiness in the way those colors are applied, changes the tone, and these writhing figures could very well be dancing. Two faceless women on trapezes, swinging through banks of mirrors, add a heavy note of self consciousness: If \"Is it real\" is the moment of trauma, in all its kaleidoscopic brutality, \"Triskaidekaptych\" is the elaborate mental process a person goes through to make sense of it.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Art & Design"}

{"text": "The irony is not lost on Ian Wardropper, the director of the Frick Collection: The very gated garden that upended the museum's previous attempt to renovate its 1914 Gilded Age mansion is now the centerpiece of its revised design. In 2015, preservationists, designers, critics and architects successfully opposed the Frick's plans to remove the garden on East 70th Street, designed by the British landscape architect Russell Page, to make way for a six story addition, by Davis Brody Bond. The new plan, by the architect Annabelle Selldorf which the Frick board approved Wednesday has situated several new elements precisely so that each provides a tranquil view of the garden: a renovated lobby; a newly created second level above the reception hall; and a new education center, cafe and expanded museum shop. In addition, the garden will be restored by Lynden B. Miller, a garden designer and preservationist, in keeping with Page's original vision. And rather than build over the garden, as previously planned, the Frick will now build beneath it, creating a 220 seat underground auditorium to better accommodate educational and public programs. \"The garden becomes the new center of the campus,\" Mr. Wardropper said in a recent interview at the museum. \"It's a beautiful garden always was. Now we're going to make the most of it.\" The Frick ended the last design process feeling battered by and somewhat bitter about critics, including the Times's own, who raised concerns about protecting the museum's intimate scale and preserving the garden. \"Gardens are works of art,\" Robert A.M. Stern, the dean of the Yale School of Architecture, said in an interview at the time. \"This one is in perfect condition by Russell Page, one of the pre eminent garden designers of the 20th century, and it should be respected as such. It's as important as a tapestry or even a painting, and I think the museum is obliged to recognize its importance.\" Had the museum been able to build its addition in the garden, Mr. Wardropper said last week, the Frick would have gained \"a proper loading dock\" and \"we wouldn't have to close\" for an estimated two years during construction. (The museum is talking to other institutions about continuing its activities in borrowed spaces during that hiatus.) But he said he doesn't feel as if the museum is settling for less. Instead, he said, the Frick has had to be more resourceful in repurposing 60,000 square feet of existing space and surgically adding 27,000 square feet, in part by building in the rear yard of the museum's art reference library on East 71st Street. \"We're able to achieve everything we need,\" Mr. Wardropper said. \"I think we've come up with a more elegant plan and a more rational one.\" Construction, which is expected to cost 160 million, is to begin in 2020 and take about two years to complete. Mr. Wardropper said he still firmly believes in the reasons behind the effort: to increase exhibition space and to improve circulation, amenities, infrastructure and wheelchair accessibility trying to meet the needs of modern audiences while honoring the building's jewel box quality. For the first time in its history, the Frick family's private living quarters on the second floor will be open to the public, helping to create 30 percent more exhibition space including a permanent gallery for the new Scher Collection of portrait medals and highlighting the experience of seeing art in an elegant home. \"The Frick has always been one of my favorite museums because you get up close to the art and you can respond to the domestic spaces in your own way,\" Ms. Selldorf said. \"You'll be able to come to the museum and do the exact same thing you do today, except that you'll be able to go up the stairs and see these rooms.\" The new design seems less likely to prompt outrage, given that the garden will be preserved, the new second level will raise the height of the lobby by less than five feet, and the museum is adding just two more floors above the mansion's music room. Moreover, both of these additions will be set back from the street. \"You will only see it if you're all the way back at the corner,\" said Ms. Selldorf, who is working with Beyer Blinder Belle, the executive architecture firm on the project. \"The closer you get, the less you see of it.\" The building addition behind the library will be the same height as the library: seven stories. The renovation's aesthetic will also be understated and honor the original building's aesthetic, using materials like Indiana limestone. \"You want it to be part of the existing volume, but have its own identity,\" Ms. Selldorf said. \"It's not apologetic, but at the same time it's not about style.\" The renovation will open the reception area, which currently becomes congested, by removing the existing circular stair to the lower level and relocating the gift shop to the second floor. A new staircase will lead down to the new coat check, bathrooms and auditorium. (The current 147 seat music room is acoustically challenged and so small that the museum must constantly turn people away.) The newly configured underground spaces will eliminate the low ceilinged galleries that could not accommodate certain works. The current show of life size portraits by the Spanish master Francisco de Zurbaran, for example, had to be displayed on the main floor, displacing a portion of the permanent collection. The Frick will also get its first dedicated space for the 100 school groups that visit every year. (They will enter the new education center through the library's 71st Street entrance.) Mr. Wardropper said the Frick's 30 million operating budget is expected to increase by 1 million or 2 million after the renovation, and its 22 admission fee is likely to go up by an undetermined amount. Given its three previous attempts to expand in recent years in 2001, 2005 and 2008 the Frick is hoping to get it right this time. \"This is the one,\" Mr. Wardropper said. Over the next few months, the Frick plans to meet with some 75 community organizations and others to present the project. Museum officials have already had initial informal discussions with the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, which has to approve the project since the Frick is in a landmark mansion, designed by Carrere and Hastings for the industrialist Henry Clay Frick. Three former members of that commission opposed the previous plan, along with a coalition, Unite to Save the Frick, that included architects and designers. Facing what the museum called \"protracted legal battles\" in pushing its plan forward, the Frick decided to go back to the drawing board.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Art & Design"}

In the process, they got an additional 1,100 square feet of living space, three acres of land, a lower tax rate and the sense that they had moved to a rural setting that didn't feel like New Jersey. \"Everyone's so spread out,\" said Ms. Nadler, 55, a language tutor who regularly bicycles through town and went snowshoeing in Jockey Hollow park after a freshly fallen snow in early March. \"I love that it feels like the country, but it's sophisticated at the same time.\" With all three sons now out of the house, the Nadlers decided to downsize, but had no intention of leaving Harding Township. \"This is my hometown,\" Ms. Nadler said, explaining their recent decision to buy a four bedroom house on three acres for 1.2 million, and to put their five bedroom, 4,828 square foot house, on four and a half acres, on the market for 1.895 million. In the last several weeks, the governing body has received final approval on its latest affordable housing plan. It has also reached an agreement to redevelop a beloved historic estate the township once sought to preserve, and set aside a piece of land in the historic center for a proposed 120 foot cell tower. Mayor Christopher Yates said that on March 1 almost four years after discussions began about how many affordable homes Harding Township needed to add to satisfy mandates by the state's Fair Housing Act court approval was received on a plan to build 176 units, just over half the original requirement of 350. Most of those homes will be built at the southern end of Route 202, the mayor said, where zoning allows for six to eight homes on an acre, compared to the three acre minimum zoning in most of the rest of the township. \"The building continued to deteriorate, and the cost quickly got well beyond what the town was willing to spend,\" Mayor Yates said. Now the township is hoping to sell Glen Alpin, which has been designated as a redevelopment area, to a private buyer after other land preservation obligations with the state are met. There is also a cellphone tower that, if approved, will go up in the New Vernon section of the township, not far from the post office, something the mayor described as simply a matter of progress. \"We're no longer the isolated little burg we once were,\" he said. \"But even with all these things coming, I don't think Harding is going to change much.\" 29 SAND SPRING LANE A Georgian revival home with seven bedrooms and seven full and two half bathrooms, built in 1938 on 32 acres, listed for 3.75 million. 908 400 2346 Horse crossing signs are a common site in Harding Township, which covers more than 20 square miles. Many properties include permanent easements for the public horse trail that runs through much of the township. Most of the homes are large and sit on lots of more than three acres, although there are two townhouse developments Shadowbrook and Harding Green along Route 202. In the Mount Kemble Lake community, 96 bungalows and cottages, some dating to the 1920s, sit on the banks of the lake. There has been little new construction in Harding in recent years, the newest being 20 large homes at Hartley Farms, each on a three acre lot surrounded by open space, as part of a 25 year plan to develop a portion of a 171 acre estate once owned by the Dodge family. Many of Harding's homes have their own septic systems and wells. The minimal public water service, along with volunteer staffed public services and the absence of a high school, helps keep property tax rates significantly lower than those in surrounding areas. Because the post offices that serve the township are in neighboring towns or in New Vernon a desirable, unincorporated community in the center of Harding, which virtually anyone can use as a mailing address by renting a postal box virtually no one receives mail addressed to Harding Township. 76 EAST LAKE TRAIL A three bedroom bungalow with two full and one half bathrooms, built in 1965 on a half acre, listed for 850,000. 973 723 5700 \"Most people who live in town have a post office box,\" said Gerry Jo Cranmer, an agent with Turpin Realtors. \"It gives them a good excuse to stop by and chat.\" The entry point for a home in most parts of Harding is north of 1 million. As of mid March, there were 37 homes on the market, with an average asking price of 2.3 million. The highest priced listing was just under 5 million for a 7,215 square foot house built in 1990 on six and a half acres; the lowest was a three bedroom 1932 colonial on a half acre, listed for 499,000. There is also a 20 room house on 32 acres owned by the family of Peter Frelinghuysen Jr., a former congressman who died in 2011, on the market for 3.75 million. 77 PLEASANTVILLE ROAD A five bedroom house with four and a half bathrooms, built in 1988 on 3.27 acres, listed for 1.48 million. 973 214 1411 According to the Garden State Multiple Listing Service, 45 houses sold in Harding Township in 2018, at an average price of 1.527 million; in 2017, 56 homes sold, at an average price of 1.395 million. Jennifer Pollaro, 39, who moved to Harding Township in 2010, said she likes to take her daughter, Eleanora, 2, and son, Frankie, 4, on guided nature walks in the 7,768 acre Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, and to the weekly story hour at the all volunteer Kemmerer Library. \"We love the big, wide open space here, where you're not on top of each other,\" she said. \"The properties are large and provide privacy, but we also have big backyards where we can have great summer parties.\" Volunteerism is big in Harding. Along with the library, the two fire departments, in New Vernon and Green Village, are staffed entirely by volunteers, as is the first aid squad in New Vernon. The Harding Land Trust, a nonprofit group, focuses on land preservation and water protection. The New Vernon Volunteer Fire Department holds two big fund raisers every year an auction in September and a lobster and steak dinner in June that draw so many visitors, there isn't enough room for them all to park, so they have to be bused in, said Tawnya Kabnick, an agent with Coldwell Banker, who lives in the Mount Kemble Lake area. There is little commercial activity in Harding, but Bernardsville, Basking Ridge, Madison and Morristown are all about a 10 minute drive away. The Harding Township School serves 315 students from prekindergarten through eighth grade. With so few students, residents say, it operates almost like a private school, with abundant individualized attention. Driving into Manhattan, about 35 miles east, during rush hour can take over an hour. Harding does not have its own train station, so commuters take New Jersey Transit trains from stations in Bernardsville, Morristown, Madison or Chatham. Travel times and costs vary: A direct train from Chatham to New York City takes about 50 minutes and costs 10.75 one way or 310 for a monthly pass; a train from Bernardsville with one stop takes 80 to 100 minutes, and costs 15 one way or 436 a month. During what has been called the \"hard winter\" of 1779 80, Henry Wick's 1,400 acre Jockey Hollow farm served as campgrounds for George Washington and the Continental Army, which cut down some 600 trees to build cabins and provide fuel for fires. More than 100 soldiers died and are buried on the property north of the Wick House which is also where Mr. Wick's daughter, Temperance, hid her horse from mutinous soldiers who tried to steal it from her, thus becoming a young hero of the Revolutionary War.

{"text": "You don't have to be Jewish to live inside a synagogue in the East Village. You only need to buy one of the three condominium apartments that have been carved out of the historic synagogue at 415 East Sixth Street, between First Avenue and Avenue A. The congregation that has occupied the building since 1910 will still be there, on the ground floor and the basement level. In fact, the condominium deal has allowed the synagogue and its building to survive. Two of the apartments include the synagogue's original, newly restored stained glass windows, and one also has an original door, now with glass cutouts to let in light, as part of a living room wall. The developer, East River Partners, subdivided the original multilevel sanctuary to create units on newly formed second, third and fourth floors, and it excavated part of the basement to add more space for the synagogue. The synagogue will design a new sanctuary on the first floor. East River Partners \"were the saviors of this shul,\" said Charles Knapp, a lawyer who is the pro bono counsel for Adas Yisroel Anshe Mezritch, the congregation that moved into the narrow space on East Sixth Street in 1910. In recent years, Mr. Knapp said, the synagogue had fallen on hard times, with a dwindling membership and few resources to maintain the building. If East River Partners hadn't stepped in, he said, \"by now the building would have been condemned by the New York City Department of Buildings.\" An earlier, controversial plan by another developer would have involved demolishing the building and replacing it with a new six story structure with a synagogue on the first two floors. After it fell through in 2008, Mr. Knapp said, no other company was interested in pursuing a project that would allow the synagogue to stay. As part of the current agreement, the developers are providing at least 20,000 annually to the congregation for the next 198 years, in addition to a 600,000 payment up front. East River is also giving the synagogue a 180,000 \"fit out allowance\" for the synagogue to design and rebuild the sanctuary and other spaces, like offices or meeting spaces in the basement. \"It's been a privilege to be able to work with the synagogue and to do something special for a historical site,\" said Joseph Cohen, one of the founders of the development firm, which specializes in small scale, often historical renovations. Jody L. Kriss, the other East River founder, said he thought the new apartments would have broad appeal. \"The buyers will be living in a space that is part of the fabric of this country's history,\" he said. The stained glass windows, some with Stars of David, have been carefully brought back to their original colors through the use of chromatography and other scientific means. The building is within a historic district designated by the Landmarks Preservation Commission in 2012, a year after East River Partners signed on, and is considered the last operating \"tenement synagogue\" in the East Village and one of the last in Manhattan, according to the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation. The elaborate front door, made of red oak and faced with copper on its outside, is being returned to its original state, though some wooden panels are being replaced by glass. The central entrance, up some stairs that were in disrepair, will no longer be used, and the gate at the bottom of the steps will be locked as well. The synagogue will use the street level entrance on the right. The condo owners will use the entrance on the left, which has an elevator going to the three apartments. \"We're very glad the building is being restored, and that the congregation will have a presence there,\" said Andrew Berman, the preservation society's executive director, adding that he wished it could have remained entirely as a house of worship. The first apartment, on the second floor, is a two bedroom, with two and a half baths, priced at 2.95 million. The third floor apartment, also with two bedrooms and two and a half baths, has a balcony and costs 3.25 million. The duplex penthouse, on the fourth and fifth floors, is priced at 4.39 million. It has no stained glass or other synagogue iconography but does have three bedrooms, two and a half baths and two terraces. The developers received permission to bump up part of the roof a little to create the second level of the penthouse, though the change is not visible from the sidewalk.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Real Estate"}
{"text": "In the first bars of Webern's arrangement of \"Tranenregen,\" a clarinet solo answered by an oboe vividly renders the two lovers sitting by a stream who become the subject of the song. In \"Des Fischers Liebesgluck,\" in a 2015 arrangement by Alexander Schmalcz, a plaintive theme is picked up by different instruments. When it is finally played up by the flute, it seems to lift up, its inherent melancholy sublimated into a spiritual dimension. Mr. Goerne's singing amply complements the full orchestral palette. His baritone has an earthy solidity in its low range, but can lighten to a soft ribbon of sound. With his striking command of legato, melodies flow in a broad stream, embedded in but never overpowered by the ensemble. The Strauss selections have Wagnerian heft and churn built into them. \"Ruhe, meine Seele\" came across as stormy and claustrophobic at once in Mr. Goerne's powerful rendition. Mr. van Zweden drew beautifully nuanced playing from the Philharmonic musicians. In \"Morgen,\" it was the orchestra's concertmaster, Frank Huang, who brought the song to a close with a solo of hushed mystery. The orchestra sounded less assured in Webern's cerebral arrangement of the Fugue from Bach's \"Musical Offering,\" which opened the program. Here, Webern isolates musical molecules and distributes them across the ensemble in a way that is devilishly hard to balance.

{"text": "More than half his life ago, when he was 19, Conor Oberst and his band Bright Eyes released their breakout album, the intricately morose \"Fevers and Mirrors.\" Already a veteran of several Omaha bands, he had been putting out music since he was 13 one of those impressive if slightly unsettling talents that gets described as a \"wunderkind.\" Oberst wrote like a punk rock Rimbaud and sang like he was perpetually on the verge of sobbing. Parents wondered why he sounded like that; a certain kind of depressed, literate adolescent saw him as a prophet. \"This room seems even smaller now than I remember it, hung mirrors on the walls and the ceiling,\" Oberst, now 40, sings on \"One and Done\" from \"Down in the Weeds Where the World Once Was,\" the new Bright Eyes album the band's 10th and first after a nine year hiatus. The song, like much of this record, is about returning home and assessing the damage: The aching chasm of what is now missing, and the strange, unexpected spoils of what still remains. What allowed him to grow into an artistic adulthood more successfully than most of his perpetual adolescent emo peers was the way he continuously widened his aperture beyond just heartbreak and teen angst to interrogate the bigger picture of why, exactly, he was so sad. By \"I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning\" in 2005, he had arrived at a compelling answer: Because he was a human being at the dawn of the 21st century, living in America. Oberst evolved into a W. Bush era bard of personal politics, but whether an act of self sabotage, artistic integrity, or a little bit of both he also never quite grew out of the more polarizing tendencies of his music: the suicidal imagery, the general sense of maximalist excess, the tantrum hoarse vocals. He gradually settled into becoming a street preaching curmudgeon of the Anthropocene, a role he easily picks up on \"Down in the Weeds.\" \"Found the through line for all humankind,\" he declares over a strummed acoustic guitar at the beginning of the swaying dirge \"Just Once in the World.\" \"If given the time, they'll blow up or walk on the moon it's just what they do.\" Lyrics that might have branded him a nihilist 15 years ago now, in the age of climate doom, ring with realism: \"Look now as the crumbling 405 falls down, oh when the big one hits,\" he sings on \"Mariana Trench,\" which pairs a driving tempo and hummable melody with visions of impending apocalypse. But Oberst has just as much catastrophe to explore on a more intimate scale. He's endured a particularly rough stretch in the past few years: He had a brain cyst removed, he got divorced, and, in 2016, his older brother Matthew one of the people who'd first inspired him to make music died suddenly in his sleep at 42. He seems to be the subject of one of the most affecting tracks on this album, \"Stairwell Song,\" an openhearted elegy with an ever intensifying melody. \"Nothing changed, you just packed your things one day,\" Oberst sings at the end. \"Didn't bother to explain what happened, you like cinematic endings.\" And with that cue, the producer Mike Mogis and the arranger and pianist Nate Walcott play him out in style with a sweeping orchestral movement. With their shape shifting, collagelike arrangements, Bright Eyes' instrumentalism often approximates some sort of sonic primordial ooze. Found sounds and out of context conversations are the band's signatures: The opening number, \"Pageturner's Rag,\" layers Walcott's ragtime piano beneath snippets of Oberst, his mother and his ex wife chatting while on mushrooms together (imagine!). Sometimes it works (the sudden intrusion of bagpipes on \"Persona Non Grata\"); sometimes it's all a bit too much and the songs feel excessively crowded. But many of the most powerful moments on this record are uncharacteristically straightforward. \"Hot Car in the Sun\" is one of the saddest Bright Eyes songs in ages, because its sadness comes not from macabre imagination but from vivid banality. \"Chopped celery and made the soup, didn't have much else to do,\" Oberst sings plaintively. \"I was dreaming of my ex wife's face.\" There is something wonderfully disarming about hearing the word \"ex wife\" in a Bright Eyes song. Her presence and eventual absence leads Oberst, as he puts it in the closing \"Comet Song,\" to \"vacuum up all of the fairy dust.\" Earlier in the song, during an argument, she'd insulted him by calling him Peter Pan. But Oberst has heard that one before; he's survived much worse. What saves \"Down in the Weeds\" from despair is its stance of battered optimism: \"This world is waving goodbye, so cut a rug, let's throw a party,\" Oberst sings with a shrug. And while it can't quite match the potency of their mid aughts records, \"Weeds\" is certainly a more festive victory lap for Bright Eyes than the underwhelming, supposedly final 2011 album \"The People's Key.\" There's no better time for a parade: In the past few years, Oberst's influence has crystallized in a new generation. He's collaborated with Phoebe Bridgers and been sampled by Young Thug; the emo rap warbler Post Malone recently admitted a habit of \"drinking and crying my expletive eyes out\" to \"I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning.\" Oberst is still sometimes written off as death obsessed, but maybe his most subversive act has been, all these years, keeping some uncompromisingly youthful part of himself alive.

Scaling this granite edifice is considered a rite of passage among elite climbers, who come from around the world to test themselves on its sheer face. But this towering behemoth is the site of frequent rockfalls. Over 20 have occurred in the last decade, including one in 2017 that killed a climber. The majority of these falls have been linked to rock formations known as flakes, sheets of rock that are peeling off El Capitan like layers of onion skin. With infrared imaging, scientists have now essentially peered behind two of the largest flakes, Boot Flake and Texas Flake, to determine how well they're connected to El Capitan. The results, presented at a meeting of the European Geosciences Union in Vienna in April, suggest that the underlying structures linking each flake to the 100 million year old granite are surprisingly small. By visualizing these attachment points, scientists can monitor them to keep climbers safe. \"This is a beautiful study,\" said Allen Glazner, a geologist at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill not involved in the research.

{"text": "LONDON The stage filled with women in Princess Diana masks, smashing VHS cassettes with hammers. A dancer wove her way through a bar, muttering about kittens. A figure wrapped in a filthy comforter emerged from a tent, crawling among clubbers dressed in fetish gear. Welcome to The Yard: London's only theater slash nightclub. The Yard opened in 2011 in a warehouse in Hackney Wick a district of East London that was once run down but has recently gentrified. The theater venue, with a 110 seat, purpose built auditorium inside a former warehouse, was meant to be temporary; eight years later, it still has a rough and ready feel, all recycled wood and corrugated roofing. Beyond staging some of London's most avant garde theater productions, there is a large bar that hosts club nights for as many as 250 people. The Yard's artistic director, Jay Miller, 34, said the festival was \"really the more radical end of our program,\" made up of \"innovating and risky\" work. So far, this year's festival, which runs through Feb. 16, has featured \"Diana is Dead\" by F.K. Alexander the aforementioned royal revenge fantasy as well as an evening of contemporary dance: Jamila Johnson Small, performing as Last Yearz Interesting Negro, and Rowdy S.S., a musician and performance artist, writhed across the stage in front of close up video images of dreadlocks and nipples. Highlights yet to come include a show by the performance artist Ira Brand about dominance and submission, and a playful monologue about time travel from the celebrated experimental theater company Forced Entertainment. Everything The Yard does is underpinned by three values, Mr. Miller said. The first is that \"the stories we tell have to feel like they aren't being told by mainstream culture,\" Mr. Miller said. \"The second is we create a space where audiences and artists feel able to take risks together. The third is we really celebrate the idea of the live moment, and what that means in a society mediated by technology.\" This can result in work that feels modish, with recent shows about social media and selfie culture. But the Yard has also produced acclaimed productions driven by bold directorial choices a relatively rare thing for new writing in British theaters, where the director is more often expected to invisibly \"serve\" the script. The theater's hip, edgy work attracts an unusually young crowd: 70 percent of the audience is under the age of 35, according to Mr. Miller. And it is breaking down the boundaries between watching a play, hanging out with a beer and raving till 6 a.m. \"Audiences are cross pollinating,\" Mr. Miller said. \"We're creating a new theater audience, who see that it can be as invigorating as dancing in a club.\" Communicating the unusual dual nature of The Yard has proved tricky, he added. Marlen Pflueger, a dance student who stuck around after a for a recent \"Lates\" offering, said she'd been to the Yard before for dance parties. \"I didn't know it was a theater,\" she said, adding, \"I think it's such a good idea to have this combination of a club and performance space,\" she said. Although it receives about 150,000 pounds, or nearly 200,000, a year in government funding, Mr. Miller said that the Yard made more money from running its own parties and renting out the bar space for events than it did from the theater, where ticket prices never go above PS20. Putting on plays and club nights can be \"exhausting\" he said, but doing so allows the Yard to stage the kind of work that other London theaters don't. Mr. Miller was drawn to Hackney Wick because it was cheap, he said. The Yard initially moved in for free. Warehouses were often broken into, and their owners were spending a lot on security, Mr. Miller said, adding, \"Us being here meant there was less chance of that happening.\" He founded The Yard in 2011 with just PS9,000 and no idea how long he could keep it going. But additional money from the government and private donors allowed Mr. Miller to turn it into something permanent at a time when Hackney Wick was changing drastically. The area's revival began with construction for the 2012 Olympics, which were largely held in East London. Today, there are plenty of trendy bars, restaurants and clubs, as well as luxury apartment developments. Mr. Miller said the changes made him uneasy. \"Artists go to places that are free, and then they're not free for other people,\" he said. Ben Bishop, The Yard's music and events coordinator, was hired in 2017, having run off grid warehouse parties for years. He said that he had always liked to collaborate with performance artist friends, and that working at an arts venue like The Yard seemed like a good way to blend both worlds. Mr. Bishop said he saw The Yard as playing an important role in supporting London's subcultures, through nights such as Pride of Arabia, which defines itself as being for \"queers from the Arab world,\" or Murder on Zidane's Floor, an event run by Goal Diggers, an East London soccer club for women and people who identify as nonbinary. Ben Bishop, The Yard's music and events coordinator, said the venue played an important role in supporting London's subcultures. Andrew Testa for The New York Times The recent narrative around London's night life has been a largely pessimistic one, with many venues closing for good, and others facing soaring costs or the denial of licenses because of concerns about noise. Mr. Bishop said that if the city's late night culture is to thrive, rather than just survive, artists and late night venues needed to collaborate. \"We should be seeing more types of art and expression in clubs,\" he said. Such cross pollination is rare in London. But The Yard is encouraging it, whether that's getting techno clubbers to buy tickets for a play, or encouraging theatergoers to stick around for a late night event. It may be an unusual vision for the future of theater but it's happening right now at The Yard.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Theater"}
{"text": "Richard Easton, left, and Robert Sean Leonard in Tom Stoppard's \"The Invention of Love\" at the Lyceum Theater in New York in 2001. Mr. Easton, who won a Tony for his performance, played A.E. Housman as an old man; Mr. Leonard played the youthful version. Richard Easton, whose frequent appearances on Broadway across 50 years included a Tony winning turn as the poet A.E. Housman in Tom Stoppard's \"The Invention of Love,\" died on Dec. 2 at his home in Manhattan. He was 86. Jonathan Walker, executor of his estate, said the cause was congestive heart failure. Mr. Easton also appeared on television and in films; his movie credits included \"Henry V\" (1989) and \"Dead Again\" (1991), both directed by Kenneth Branagh, with whom he had acted on the stage in England. But he was first and foremost a stage actor, turning in memorable performances in both classical and modern fare, aided by a vocal dexterity that might find him booming in one scene, comically sputtering in another. \"He was a wonder,\" Ethan Hawke, who was cast with him in several plays, said by email, \"and like many other young actors, I quickly became a disciple. His intelligence, wit, experience, honesty and his voice rendered him a commanding presence in our lives.\" One of Mr. Easton's most famous moments onstage, though, was of a kind no actor wants. During a preview performance of Part 1 of Mr. Stoppard's \"The Coast of Utopia\" at the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center in October 2006, he collapsed in midperformance, the result of an arrhythmia. Mr. Hawke and Martha Plimpton were onstage, their characters having just received a tongue lashing from Mr. Easton, who was playing their father. \"I said, 'This is my last word,' and I took two steps towards the wings, one, two, and crashed like a tree in the forest,\" Mr. Easton recalled in a 2010 video made for Lincoln Center Theater. \"Ethan has always been grateful to me because he had the opportunity to say the immortal line 'Is there a doctor in the house?,'\" Mr. Easton continued. \"And I said to him afterwards: 'Are you kidding? On the Upper West Side of New York City, is there a doctor in the house? Of course there's a doctor in the house.'\" Several audience members did indeed step forward, Mr. Hawke recalled, although he said it was a member of the stage crew who initially administered crucial CPR. The play's formal opening was delayed three weeks, until Nov. 27. The production was the first part of \"The Coast of Utopia\" trilogy. Parts 2 and 3 opened soon after, and the plays ran in repertory. Mr. Easton, newly fitted with a pacemaker, was in all three. Jack O'Brien, who directed Mr. Easton in \"The Coast of Utopia\" and many other productions, including \"The Invention of Love\" in 2001, shared a list of practical advice for young actors that Mr. Easton had drawn up years ago when they worked together at the Old Globe in San Diego and Mr. Easton taught at the University of San Diego. One Easton rule advised, \"When it comes to a coin toss (which it does, most of the time!) to decide casting between one actor and another, 'Very good actor but rather difficult' will lose out, nine point six times out of ten, to 'Pretty good and really very, very nice!'\" Mr. O'Brien, in a telephone interview, added, \"There's a generation of young men and women indebted to Richard, not only for his friendship but for professional specifics.\" John Richard Easton was born on March 22, 1933, in Montreal. His father, Leonard, was an engineer, and his mother, Mary Louisa (Withington) Easton, was a homemaker. Mr. Easton began acting as a teenager, working with a children's theater and the semiprofessional Montreal Repertory Theater, commanding attention despite his youth. One play he was cast in was \"The Rivals\" by Richard Brinsley Sheridan, in which he played the squire Bob Acres. (Christopher Plummer, another young actor working his way toward stardom, was also in that production.) Some 55 years later, in 2004, Mr. Easton would be in \"The Rivals\" again, in a different role, that of Sir Anthony Absolute; this time the production was on Broadway. \"Mr. Easton's alternately blustery and delicate rendering of Sir Anthony's outraged dignity and wounded pride is priceless,\" Charles Isherwood wrote in his review in The New York Times. But Broadway was still a ways in the future. At 17 he moved to Ottawa to work in a repertory company that put on 33 plays in 35 weeks, a crash course in all things theatrical. In 1953 he performed with the company of the newly created Stratford Festival in Ontario, then won a scholarship to study at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. He worked in England for two years, at one point playing opposite one of his heroes, John Gielgud, in \"King Lear.\" He returned to Canada, then signed on with the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Conn., where John Houseman was artistic director. (Mr. Easton was later able to say that he had worked at all three Stratfords: in Ontario and Connecticut and at Stratford upon Avon in England.) In 1957 Mr. Houseman took \"Measure for Measure,\" \"The Taming of the Shrew\" and \"The Duchess of Malfi\" to Broadway; Mr. Easton was in all three, his first Broadway credits. He appeared regularly on Broadway for the rest of the 1950s, throughout the '60s and into the early '70s, in plays that included \"Pantagleize\" (1967), \"The Misanthrope\" (1968) and \"Hamlet\" (1969). He spent much of the '70s back in England, where he was part of the cast of \"The Brothers,\" a BBC drama that ran from 1972 to 1976. He joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in the mid 1980s and stayed for four years before joining Mr. Branagh's breakaway theatrical troupe, Renaissance Theater. Then came a decade in San Diego, working with Mr. O'Brien.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Theater"}
{"text": "Revolution has come to Bucharest, and a society has exploded into shards. A multitude of writhing, flailing, falling bodies fills the screen during the climax of the second act of Ashley Tata's fervently inventive new streaming version of Caryl Churchill's \"Mad Forest,\" a coproduction of Theater for a New Audience and the Fisher Center at Bard College. This is not, however, your average mob scene. Each of the participants in this upheaval and there are a dozen, to be exact, though they feel like many more is isolated in one of those separate, self contained frames many of us now identify with Zoom conferences. They all seem to share an astonishment, mixed with elation and terror, at the chaos that has descended upon what had been a rigidly regimented world. One is locked in a self stranglehold; another appears to be wiping the window of the lens that separates us, trying to get a clear view; others claw the air and scream silently, while yet another would seem to be vogueing. While these achingly young looking people are all responding to the same cataclysmic events, their reactions are so isolatingly different. It has seldom felt lonelier in a crowd. The cast of this streamlined, Zoom formatted version of Churchill's 1990 play a portrait of Romania before and after the fall of the Ceausescu dictatorship in December 1989 is made up of college students in the Bard Theater and Performance Program. (The production will be streamed again on Sunday at 5 p.m. and Wednesday at 3 p.m., via tfana.org.) And as they deploy their varied, idiosyncratic gestures, you can imagine the workshop improvisation from which they sprang. It's a style of performance that might come across as embarrassingly earnest on a stage. But in this context, all that quirky, mismatched intensity felt deeply moving. The cast members were portraying witnesses to and participants in the Bucharest uprising who had been interviewed by Churchill, the director Mark Wing Davey and a team of 10 acting students shortly after those events occurred. The part of \"Mad Forest\" shaped from those interviews evolved from Churchill, her team and their subjects trying to make sense of something that seemed to make no sense at all. Now, some 30 years later, a group of students roughly the same age as many of the scene's characters is trying to make personal, individual sense of the same material. \"Mad Forest\" seen in Manhattan in a New York Theater Workshop production in 1991 has always been about the difficulties of translation, in several ways. And be warned, this mixture of documentary, domestic and surreal drama can feel bewildering even in conventional stagings. Each of the scenes in the first and third acts portraying the fictional stories of two Romanian families of different classes is preceded by a guidebook like sentence spoken in Romanian and then in English. So you are always aware of \"Mad Forest\" occurring through various filters of interpretation, as it confronts an elusive, very tangled reality. (The title comes from a description of the woodland where Bucharest was built that \"was impenetrable to the foreigner who did not know its paths.\") Tata's version which achieved its present form when the stage production in rehearsal had to be canceled because of the pandemic adds still another layer of interpretive tools and filters. Each of the performances, by actors sheltering in place in different locations, is occurring separately. It's only the inspired work of the technical team that creates the illusion of their inhabiting the same space. The conjured landscapes include both urban streetscapes and countryside idylls; claustrophobically cozy apartments and hospital corridors. They have been summoned via green screens and projections under the supervision of Afsoon Pajoufar (sets), Abigail Hoke Brady (lighting) and Eamonn Farrell (video). Just as startling is the meticulous choreography of the ensemble (by Daniel Safer, with nerve scraping music and sound by Paul Pinto). Money seems to change hands between an abortion provider and his client in adjacent frames, a vampire bites a dog, a ghost visits a nurse in a hospital, and a wedding erupts into a body slamming free for all.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Theater"}
{"text": "Josh Lindblom, a pitcher for the Milwaukee Brewers, was not expecting a lot last weekend when he turned on his television looking for sports. But what he found was a bit much. \"They had two guys on there playing Tetris against each other,\" Lindblom said, laughing. But now, American sports fans starved for live games may find a measure of salvation from an unlikely source: South Korean baseball. The Korea Baseball Organization season begins Tuesday, and ESPN has announced plans for live broadcasts of its games. Lindblom, 32, planned to be watching. The right hander, currently riding out the pandemic with his family in Lafayette, Ind., pitched four and a half seasons in the South Korean league, winning back to back Choi Dong won awards (given to the league's best pitcher) in 2018 and 2019 and the league's Most Valuable Player Award last year. On behalf of baseball aficionados eager for some live action, then, The New York Times asked Lindblom and a group of insiders for advice on how best to savor the South Korean brand of baseball. \"People are clearly looking for something to cheer for,\" Lindblom said, \"something to follow other than the news.\" Baseball on the other side of the world is still baseball even if spitting on the field has been temporarily banned. But American fans will notice subtle differences and quirks in the South Korean game. There is, for example, a ton of variability in talent on K.B.O. lineups. A team might field a player who could be a star in Major League Baseball but also play someone who would just barely make an M.L.B. bench and others who would fit best in the minor leagues. \"There's 65 or 70 high schools that play baseball in Korea, so they're drawing from a much smaller talent pool,\" said Aaron Tassano, an international scout for the Samsung Lions, whose season opening game against the NC Dinos aired on ESPN on Tuesday. The K.B.O. is regarded as an offense centric league, with cozy ballparks. But the league has taken steps in recent years to shift the advantage away from its hitters, including \"de juicing\" the ball and expanding the notoriously small strike zone. And while the Korean game has more firepower and players swinging for the fences than the Japanese league, it might still come across to fans as \"refreshingly old school,\" Tassano said. \"There's bunting and stealing,\" he said. \"Their game has not been taken over by launch angles and spin rate to the degree it has here. I love those things about the game here, but there's a purity to the game there that I enjoy.\" Every person interviewed for this story rued the same thing about Korean baseball's current chance in the spotlight: the lack of fans because of restrictions related to the virus. Korean games provide nine innings of near constant noise and color: Each club has a cheerleading team that guides fans through buoyant singing routines, with bespoke songs for every batter who steps up to the plate. \"And they'll be singing even if you're losing, 15 0,\" said Brett Pill, who played for the Kia Tigers from 2014 to 2016 and is now the hitting coach for the Tulsa Drillers, the Los Angeles Dodgers' Class AA team. The typical K.B.O. game, then, combines the raucous energy of a college football stadium with the subject specific singing of an English soccer match. \"They can make a 20,000 seat stadium sound bigger than the 50,000 seat stadiums we have in the States,\" said Eric Hacker, who pitched in South Korea from 2013 to 2018. For now, though, the ballparks have been so quiet that the sound of players swearing and umpires making calls could be clearly discerned on preseason broadcasts. Who are the Yankees of the K.B.O.? Dan Kurtz, a stay at home father in Tacoma, Wash., created the website MyKBO.net in 2003 for the small community of English speaking fans of the league. These days, the website, which maintains its charmingly homemade aesthetic, remains one of the best sources of up to date results for teams and players. Asked which teams American fans might want to follow, Kurtz noted that fandom does not always adhere to some complex logic. He joked, for instance, that anyone who used a Samsung phone could root for the Samsung Lions. The Doosan Bears have had the most success recently, making it to the championship series in each of the past five seasons and winning it three times. And the Kia Tigers have the most historical success, with 11 championships, leading fans to compare them to the Yankees, even if they have been less than stellar in recent years. Kurtz said Mets fans, on the other hand, might relate to the L.G. Twins, who play second fiddle to the Bears in Seoul, have not won a title since 1994 and, to really drive home the comparison, have a reputation for falling short of expectations. Most baseball fans now know that celebratory bat flips, frowned upon or worse in the M.L.B., are prevalent and accepted as harmless in South Korea. Korean baseball, then, clearly has its own decorum. For instance, if a pitcher hits a batter with the ball, there is an expectation that he will tip his cap or make some other conciliatory gesture toward his opponent. And in a country where age based hierarchies often dictate interpersonal behavior, apologies toward older opponents tend to be even more pronounced. \"If you're a 24 year old pitcher and you hit Lee Dae ho, you better take off your hat and bow,\" Kurtz said, referring to the 37 year old slugger for the Lotte Giants. \"Benches have cleared because of things like that.\" Lindblom said he embraced opportunities to offer displays of sportsmanship to highly regarded opponents like Lee Seung yuop, the K.B.O. career home runs leader, who retired after the 2017 season. \"Every time he would step in the box, I would bow, just as a sign of respect,\" Lindblom said of Lee, who hit a combined 626 homers in Korea and Japan. Get to know South Korean stars. Fans in the United States might naturally be drawn to the American players in the league teams can have up to three international players on their rosters or Korean players who spent time in the major leagues. But our experts encouraged fans to learn more about lesser known South Korean players. Pill was most enthusiastic about a pudgy 33 year old pitcher for the Doosan Bears named Yoo Hee kwan, who throws a curveball that sometimes hovers around 50 miles per hour. \"He's this very small, little left handed pitcher, who probably tops out at 83,\" Pill said, referring to his fastball velocity. \"But he would hit the inside corner every time and then throw a changeup that just fell off the plate. You saw the ball well, but you couldn't hit it.\" Lindblom said the best overall player in the K.B.O., in his opinion, was Yang Eui ji, the 32 year old catcher for the NC Dinos. \"He's a really smart player, a great situational hitter and is also a guy who's got some power.\" Lindblom said. \"He's just a tough out. He's one of the better defensive catchers, also.\" Kurtz mentioned three Korean players who seemed most likely to make the jump to America in the coming years: Kim Ha seong, 24, a gifted shortstop who batted .307 last season, with 19 home runs; Na Sung bum, 30, an athletic outfielder with good power and a strong arm, who is trying to come back from a serious leg injury he suffered in 2019; and Yang Hyeon jong, who compiled a 2.29 ERA and 163 strikeouts in 184.2 innings last year and has won two Choi Dong won awards in his career. \"You've got to have an open mind,\" Kurtz said \"You're going to see some good players, and you're going to see some stuff you've probably never seen, even in the minor leagues. But that's why you watch.\"", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Sports"}
{"text": "There were three winners at Sunday's Marathon Project, a bright spot in an otherwise uncertain year for professional runners. Sara Hall, racing just 11 weeks after her second place finish at the London Marathon, won the women's race in 2 hours 20 minutes 32 seconds, a personal best and the second fastest time ever run by an American woman. Martin Hehir, a fourth year medical student who was coming off weeks of treating Covid 19 patients in an intensive care unit in Philadelphia, ran the race of his life in 2:08:59, also a personal best. But perhaps the biggest winners were the organizers themselves, coaches and agents who pulled off a world class marathon in a year lacking racing opportunities. As they watched other sports and leagues return, they realized that if their athletes were going to have a chance to race before the end of the year, they were going to have to make it happen themselves. Runners were suffering amid the uncertainty, said Josh Cox, an agent to many professional runners. \"I served as part agent, part therapist for my athletes this year.\" Ben Rosario, head coach of Northern Arizona Elite, a professional training group based in Flagstaff, said some of his runners were feeling low. \"Athletes need to perform,\" he said. \"When you take away the race piece, training is no longer fun.\" Rosario initially envisioned holding the race on a motor racetrack, but Matt Helbig of Big River Race Management pointed him to a road he had been studying on the Gila River Indian Community. \"We rode the course in a golf cart and I called Matt and Josh and said, 'This the place,'\" Rosario said. The road was flat with no potholes and few turns. David Katz, a course measuring expert, spent the days before the race making the turns on the 4.26 mile circuit more gradual and therefore faster. Katz wanted to be on site to place the mile and kilometer markers himself, and he even marked the first hundred meters for the pacesetters. The safety precautions mirrored those seen in other athletic facilities. Everyone on site including the 40 women and 48 men racing had to submit negative coronavirus tests. The pre race news conference and technical meeting were held through video calls, with athletes logging in from their respective hotel rooms. Course monitors wore masks, and volunteers handling the athletes' water bottles wore masks and gloves. Some runners were masked as they warmed up among the cactuses and shrubs. While the prize purse was minimal 5,000 for first place, 2,000 for second, 1,000 for third time bonuses, contract obligations and Olympic spots for the Canadian and Mexican athletes were on the line. Runner took risks from the gun. It's 2020, after all. There was nothing to lose. Twelve women ran under 2:30 and seven men finished faster than 2:10 the first time that's happened in U.S. history, reshuffling the American career lists for both men and women. Andrea Ramirez Limon (2:26:34) and Ursula Patrica Sanchez Garcia (2:29:11) of Mexico and Natasha Wodak (2:26:19) of Canada hit the Olympic standard of a time under 2 hours, 29 minutes and 30 seconds, with hopes of earning a spot on their Olympic teams. Hall, 37, had requested a pace group aimed at taking down Deena Kastor's American record of 2:19:36. She held on for the win, missing the record by 56 seconds, but became the second fastest American female marathoner at 2:20:32. Keira D'Amato, who came into the race with the American record in the 10 mile, landed a second place finish in 2:22:56, setting a personal best time by 11 minutes. A large group of men went out on a 2:09 pace, including the eventual winner Hehir, followed by a chase pack aimed at 2:11, just under the men's Olympic standard of 2:11:30. Hehir, 28, tucked into the back of the pack, letting the pacers do the work as he tried to burn as little energy as possible. Hehir moved to the front through miles 20 and 22 and took the lead when the pacers dropped off. He crossed the finish in 2:08:59, a personal best by two and half minutes. \"This race was really a validation of my whole running career,\" said Hehir, who took sixth at the U.S. Olympic marathon trials in February. To be able to race safely amid the pandemic was a gift, he said. While his wife and two young daughters fed his spirits in the evenings, his training runs fired him up in the early mornings, keeping him afloat at the hospital as the coronavirus continued to surge. \"The organizers deserve a standing ovation,\" Hehir said. \"Josh and Ben knew exactly what we athletes needed. They thought through every detail. It was a real testament to the sport, to see it go from being really knocked down, to seeing this grass root, bottom up effort done so the sport could advance.\"", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Sports"}
{"text": "In any other year, N.F.L. facilities across the country would be buzzing this week, when teams are allowed to begin their off season workout programs, the first organized football activities since they ended the prior season. Normally, this is a time when teammates are reunited for workouts and position meetings. Coaches get their first in person look at free agent signees, and trainers assess how injured players are recovering. But like nearly all other nonessential businesses in the country, N.F.L. teams are in lockdown, with all coaches, players and staff working from home. This has thrown one of the most critical stretches of the league's calendar into flux, and forced the N.F.L. and its players' union to develop a host of rules changes. Teams have scrambled to adapt to working from home, and the coronavirus advisories have put the N.F.L. at the mercy of government and health officials. Unlike other pro sports leagues, whose seasons were fractured by the pandemic, the N.F.L., despite the turmoil, has had an easier time so far. Its first game isn't until Sept. 10. Still, the league and the N.F.L. Players Association had to create one set of guidelines for 32 teams, 2,000 players and hundreds of coaches, trainers and other staff. \"We're going to treat all 32 teams the same way,\" Jeff Pash, the N.F.L.'s general counsel, told reporters last week. \"We'll do it in a way that does preserve competitive equity.\" The league said its three week virtual off season, which is voluntary for players, would include classroom instruction with digital playbooks as well as workouts and nonfootball educational programs. The league has given teams the autonomy to organize their own training sessions and classes. They can send players workout equipment worth up to 1,500. While the off season workouts are voluntary, every team is expected to take part, especially this year, when coaches are prevented from meeting players in person. This is particularly true for teams with new head coaches, who were able to start on Monday, while all other teams can begin next Monday. Teams that do not take part in the off season workouts in the first three week period cannot take part in the second phase of the off season, which begins on May 18. Without in person accountability, the remote work will compel teams to determine how to validate that players have participated. Players who take part in the virtual off season minicamps and workouts will receive 235 per day. But players who are eligible to earn additional off season workout bonuses, which can be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, must take part to be paid. Teams specify a percentage of workouts that players must complete to receive contract bonuses. Teams are also facing the prospect of losing out on the intangible interactions that can unite players ahead of a long season. None Week 11 Predictions: Here are our picks against the spread. N.F.L. Tightens Covid Protocols: As cases rise and Thanksgiving approaches, the league is requiring masks inside team facilities and increasing testing. The Packers' Defense Is Their M.V.P.: Green Bay's oft overlooked defense has kept the team from falling out of the Super Bowl chase.

Playoff Simulator: Explore every team's path to the postseason, updated live. \"We're going to miss that camaraderie, the badgering that goes back and forth, and the direct communication with the coaches, teammates who lean over and whisper to help out on a play,\" John Schneider, general manager of the Seattle Seahawks, said. Schneider said he was trusting players to follow the workouts given to them by the strength and conditioning staff members, who are emphasizing flexibility and core strength. \"This isn't going to be a virtual workout that we monitor,\" he said. \"In this day and age, these guys do such a good job taking care of themselves anyway.\" The Seahawks, like other teams, are focused on having coaches meet online with players, individually and in groups. That starts with meetings by position, as well as meetings for offensive, defensive and special teams squads. As he does when the Seahawks are together in Renton, Wash., Coach Pete Carroll will drop in on different meetings during the day. Peter Ruocco, senior vice president for labor relations at the N.F.L., said teams could also send players video to watch. Teams can work with players online for two hours a day within a four hour window, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., Eastern time. \"They can also take two hours where they would identify, OK, here's the time frame that you will be participating in club directed activities,\" Ruocco said last week. \"That would be classroom activities, or if they are doing a virtual workout, they could direct them for the virtual workout. But it could be either or, it could be live or it could be taped.\" One question left unanswered is how the league will monitor teams to ensure they do not ask their players to do work outside the established guidelines. \"Teams try to get every competitive advantage they can get,\" Gabe Feldman, the director of the Sports Law Program at Tulane University, said. \"The players may have too much time on their hands, but also the teams could load up the players with too much work.\" After the first part of the virtual off season ends on May 15, teams that took part can continue for another six weeks. If state governments do not lift their stay at home orders by then, teams will have to continue working virtually. To maintain fairness, if even one N.F.L. team is unable to reopen its facility, then all franchises will have to continue following the virtual off season guidelines. This requirement, while entirely understandable, means the league must follow the instructions of health officials in the 24 states where its teams train. The challenge for the N.F.L. is that while the number of cases appears to be cresting in cities like Seattle, it is rising in other N.F.L. cities, including the smallest, Green Bay, Wis. The number of cases in Brown County, where Green Bay is, increased more than fourfold from April 7 to 17. While the absolute number of cases is relatively low, health investigators, including those from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reportedly visited Brown County over the weekend, according to The Green Bay Press Gazette. The wave of hot spots in N.F.L. cities makes it more likely the league will have to extend its virtual off season training program past May 15, and force the league to yet again adapt to circumstances out of its control.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Sports"}
{"text": "As tomato growers in Florida and some other states fight a 16 year old agreement that they contend allows farmers in Mexico to export tomatoes at a price below their costs, the Mexican farmers are finding allies in the United States. The trade dispute highlights the network of interlocking interests between the countries under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Trade across the Mexican border is now worth more than 1 billion a day. American producers of corn, soybeans, apples, pork and chicken have increased sales to Mexico greatly over the years as trade barriers have been dismantled. But at the same time, Mexico has become a fast growing supplier of produce to American supermarkets and restaurants. Tomatoes lead the list: exports have doubled and their value has tripled since the mid 1990s, to almost 2 billion. That has been aided by a complex arrangement dating from 1996 that established a minimum price at which Mexican tomatoes are permitted to enter the American market. Florida farmers are leading a campaign to persuade the Commerce Department to scrap the accord. They won a victory in September when the department announced a preliminary decision to end it. Lawyers in the case say a final decision may be issued in the next few weeks. But other United States interests are lining up in support of continuing the agreement. For example, Richard Fimbres, a member of the Tucson City Council who is usually more concerned with improving city streets than with the minutiae of international trade law, recently sponsored a resolution asking the Commerce Department to continue the agreement. Then he wrote to President Obama last month, declaring that \"we can't turn our back on the global economy now.\" The reason is that fresh Mexican tomatoes are big business in Arizona. Much of the 2 billion in business passes through the state, benefiting local importers and distributors. But the benefits go beyond them. More than 370 businesses and trade groups from small family run importers on the Mexico border to Wal Mart Stores have written or signed letters to the Commerce Department in favor of continuing the deal. \"Yes, Mexico produces their tomatoes on average at a lower cost than Florida; that's what we call competitive advantage,\" Mr. Ahern said in an e mail. Without the agreement to provide \"stability to a volatile market, Mexican tomato acreage destined for U.S. markets will decline,\" he said, and that would damage his business. While Florida tomato growers contend the accord is hurting their business, the broader trade dynamics are generating business for other companies in the United States. \"A lot of what is produced and harvested in Mexico is put in the ground with U.S. money and intended for U.S. markets,\" said John McClung, the president and chief executive of the Texas International Produce Association. \"The garden simply happens to be across the river.\" NatureSweet Ltd., which is based in San Antonio, grows cherry and grape tomatoes under 1,200 acres of greenhouses in Mexico for the American market. It employs 5,000 people, although all but about 100 of them work in Mexico. Today in On Tech: Imagine not living in Big Tech's world. Dollar Tree will raise prices to 1.25 by the end of April. \"We couldn't survive without Nafta,\" said Bryant Ambelang, the company's chief executive. Mr. Ambelang said that Mexican grown tomatoes were more competitive because of lower labor costs, good weather and more than a decade of investment in greenhouse technology. \"Here we went and signed an agreement called Nafta, and now we're going to go and wave our finger in one industry where Mexico has superiority?\" he said. Mr. McClung said that even though Texas lost much of its commercial fresh tomato industry years ago, \"we can do quite nicely importing Mexican tomatoes.\" He acknowledged that growers in Florida and elsewhere were \"going slowly under.\" But, he added, \"my job is to protect Texas importers.\" The complex 1996 trade accord was struck after Florida farmers asked the Commerce Department to impose antidumping duties on Mexican tomatoes. Their complaint was suspended after Mexico's largest producers agreed to ship their tomatoes at a minimum price, ensuring they could not sell at prices that might undercut Florida production. But Edward Beckman, president of Certified Greenhouse Farmers, a trade group for American and Canadian growers, argues that conditions have changed since then. The \"current playing field is tilted completely against domestic interests, and we need to quickly address the unfair trade that exists,\" he said in a recent statement. Consumers have come to expect year round tomatoes, said Bill Piper, the vice president and general manager of Grant County Foods in Dry Ridge, Ky., a large produce wholesaler and repacker that buys tomatoes from Florida and Mexico. If it becomes harder to import Mexican tomatoes, he said, \"people will have to put up signs: 'We have tomatoes today' or 'We don't have tomatoes today.' \" Scott DeFife, executive vice president at the National Restaurant Association, said that \"people want tomato based dishes all the time.\" He added, \"You plan over the course of the year where you are going to get your supply in the winter, the spring, the fall.\" Without tomatoes from Mexico, a winter freeze in Florida, for example, would send prices shooting up, he said. If the 1996 deal were canceled, importers, distributors and retailers said they suspect that American growers would file a new antidumping complaint against Mexican tomatoes. Under that process, the Commerce Department could impose tariffs on Mexican tomatoes if it determined that the Mexicans were selling below their costs. Even if the department eventually found that the Mexicans were not dumping, a complaint itself would have a chilling effect on trade.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Global Business"}

The A400M project is nearly four years behind schedule and more than 7 billion euros over budget, and the plane itself is several tons overweight.

{"text": "Responding to calls to make French industry more competitive by reducing labor costs, the Socialist government of President Francois Hollande said Tuesday that it would cut payroll taxes for businesses. But the government stopped short of adopting the broader changes that an expert panel led by a prominent business executive, Louis Gallois, recommended a day earlier in a report that called for a \"competitiveness shock\" to the French economy. Prime Minister Jean Marc Ayrault, after a meeting of officials to discuss the economy, said in a statement on Tuesday that the government had to act because \"France has known 10 years of industrial stagnation.\" If the trend were allowed to continue, he added, the country's decline \"would be a certainty.\" The government's plan to cut payroll taxes by 20 billion euros, or 25.6 billion, over three years is \"a cultural shift for the French Socialists,\" said Gilles Moec, an economist at Deutsche Bank in London. \"They've always looked with suspicion on the idea that there was a labor cost problem in France.\" To make up for the revenue shortfall, the government plans to raise the main sales tax while also making budget cuts. The Gallois report notes that France has lost 750,000 industrial jobs over the last decade as the country's trade balance has deteriorated. Prominent among the report's criticisms is that the tax burden borne by businesses and their employees as well as contracts and rules that make it difficult to fire workers renders French industry uncompetitive. The centerpiece of the response announced by Mr. Ayrault is a payroll tax cut that will lower the cost of labor for French companies. In theory, that would encourage new investment and reinvigorate exports. The first stages of the tax break will be applied to businesses' 2013 taxes when they file in 2014. By 2016, the 20 billion euro tax break would be fully in place and offset by 10 billion euros of yet unspecified spending cuts and at least 3 billion euros in environmentally focused \"green taxes,\" as well as money from the higher sales tax. The size of the payroll tax reduction is in line with the recommendation of the government commissioned report prepared by the panel led by Mr. Gallois, a former chief executive of European Aeronautic Defense and Space. The report offered proposals meant to revive the French economy. But its prospects for success remain to be seen. The government chose to phase in the reduction over three years, rather than the one or two years Mr. Gallois said was necessary for the full impact. And it rejected his proposal that the share of payroll taxes paid by employees be cut by 10 billion euros. Mr. Ayrault said the tax credit would work out to a 6 percent reduction in social security charges on workers who make up to 2.5 times the minimum wage, which is now 9.40 euros an hour. Paying for the measures will require the government to break a vow by Mr. Ayrault in September that there would be no increase in sales taxes during Mr. Hollande's five year term. The decision could prove highly unpopular on the left because sales taxes are among the most regressive levies a state can impose, with the burden falling disproportionately on the poor, who spend a higher portion of their income than the rich do. The main sales tax, the value added tax, will rise in January 2014 to 20 percent from 19.6 percent, but the minimum value added tax, on basic needs like food, will fall to 5 percent from 5.5 percent. Today in On Tech: Imagine not living in Big Tech's world. Dollar Tree will raise prices to 1.25 by the end of April. The \"intermediate tax,\" which covers things like restaurant meals and home renovations, will rise to 10 percent from 7 percent. Mr. Hollande won the French election in June, and the confidence of many investors, with a promise to bring France's 2013 budget deficit down to 3 percent the standard set by the European Union from about 4.5 percent this year. But many economists and some of his allies on the left have argued that cutting spending and raising taxes could weaken the economy further at a time when the euro zone is in recession and the global economy is faltering. The focus on cutting labor costs \"is an economic misdiagnosis, it's a social error,\" Jean Claude Mailly, secretary general of Force Ouvriere, a relatively militant union, told Europe 1 radio on Tuesday. It will lead to \"social dumping,\" he said, because the Germans will feel obligated to cut their own labor costs. \"It will never end,\" he added. France's welfare state, one of the world's most generous, is largely financed by payroll taxes. And the so called social wedge the reduction in workers' take home pay that results from the taxes paid by them and their employers is among the largest in the world, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Unions and others on the left fear that reductions in financing for the system could lead to pressure for reduction in benefits for workers that include universal health care and solid pensions. Jorg Kramer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, noted that Germany had gone through its own labor market restructuring over the last decade. A core element of that program, he said, was a sharp reduction in benefits to the long term unemployed and a wider availability of temporary work, which put pressure on the unemployed to take any job. The result was a more flexible labor market and more moderate wage demands. The International Monetary Fund forecast on Monday that the French economy would expand 0.4 percent in 2013, after 0.1 percent this year. Mr. Moec of Deutsche Bank said the government's action would probably have little immediate economic effect. \"I don't want to diminish the symbolic significance of what they've announced today,\" Mr. Moec said, \"but the impact will probably be less than what the government would like to communicate.\" For one thing, he noted, businesses are already facing a tax increase next year, \"and this will partially offset that.\" To some extent Mr. Hollande's government is giving back what it has already taken away. It raised business taxes in July as part of a supplementary budget. The 2013 budget that was introduced in September ended the full deductibility of interest payments, a de facto tax increase.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Global Business"}
{"text": "When faced with a loss in the market versus a lapse in his faith, Nabeel Hamoui, 37, a radiologist in Chicago, will invariably opt for the loss. This is because Dr. Hamoui manages his retirement portfolio in accordance with halal, or religiously sanctioned, Islamic guidelines. \"I chose halal investing based on my religious beliefs, and try to remain in compliance with those beliefs,\" Dr. Hamoui said. A return on his investment, he said, is beside the point. For Dr. Hamoui and many other Muslims, both in the United States and abroad, saving for retirement means steering clear of investments in companies and funds that trade in a host of forbidden goods and services, which are known as haram. The lengthy list includes alcohol, tobacco, pork products and media or entertainment considered immoral, such as pornography. The rules can be tricky to navigate. Investments are banned in companies with too much debt as a percentage of their assets. Interest on loans (known as riba) is also haram, which rules out investing in conventional banking and insurance sectors. Investing in companies earning a minimal amount of interest, typically 5 percent or less, may be allowed, so long as the dividend income derived from that interest is donated to charity. Equally problematic are many customary market gambits such as annuities and short selling, which can be viewed as gambling, and thus are prohibited under Islamic law, or Shariah. \"The Islamic principles look to what you are doing with your capital, what types of businesses, assets and operations are you furthering,\" said Umar Moghul, a New York based lawyer specializing in Islamic finance. Other important criteria, he said, are the terms and conditions of someone's holdings, \"since Shariah also speaks to procedure as well as to the substance of investment.\" In spite of these challenges, the global Islamic financial sector is healthy and growing. While the bulk of the Islamic financial sector's assets lie in Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, financial services managers in the United States are addressing the retirement savings needs and dollars of a steadily growing number of observant Muslim Americans, now about 1 percent of the United States population. Their economic profiles show them to be slightly more likely than non Muslim workers to be engaged in professional careers, according to a 2009 Gallup Poll, and as likely as other Americans to earn annual incomes in excess of 100,000, according to a 2011 Pew Research Center study. Islamic finance in the United States is \"a nascent industry, but people are very optimistic about where it is going,\" said Bashar Qasem, the chief executive of Azzad Asset Management, a money management firm in Falls Church, Va., that he founded in 1997. The philosophy behind Islamic saving and investing can be traced to the Quran and other early Islamic texts. The story of the prophet Yusuf (Joseph, the same one as in the Bible) conserving grain from rich harvests in Egypt, related in Sura (chapter) 12 of the Quran, is often cited as an admonition to save against hard times. Other verses advise against squandering wealth, while the Prophet Muhammad warned in a hadith (a collection of his sayings) that one \"who is prudent in spending will not be dependent on others\" later in life. Both the Quran and hadith inform Shariah, which guides Muslims through practical life decisions, including how they should make and save money while remaining true to their religious principles. \"Because Islam tends not to distinguish between the temporal and the religious, there is a perennial desire among Muslims to live all aspects of their lives, including the financial, in a manner consistent with their faith,\" observed Usman Hayat and Adeel Malik, the authors of a 2014 study of Islamic finance by the CFA Institute. The Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions, Malaysia's Islamic Financial Services Board and Bahrain's International Islamic Financial Market are among the major independent organizations that help Muslims achieve these goals. Advised by boards of Islamic financial experts and religious scholars, these organizations continually and systematically review companies, bonds and mutual funds to ensure they are Shariah compliant. The vetted products are listed on various Islamic indexes that have concurrently emerged. \"As Islamic funds were being developed, there was a need for benchmarks, and so we were responding to the needs of the assets management industry,\" said Michael Orzano, the head of equity indices at S P's Dow Jones Indices. The original Dow Jones Islamic Market Index was introduced in 1999 as the world's first Shariah compliant index. Today, the company's portfolio of more than 15,000 indexes is among many offered by major financial firms. Like Shariah itself, which varies in interpretation (known as ijtihad), the indexes differ on what is compliant and what is not. Most regard the trade and manufacture of weapons as noncompliant, for example, yet S P's board of Islamic scholars takes a nuanced approach. The use of weapons can be permissible (self defense) or nonpermissible (unprovoked violence), but the weapons themselves are neutral, so investing in their manufacture is sanctioned, as Mr. Orzano noted in a 2013 report. A vast range of customized, equally nuanced Islamic financial products structured like standard investments but operating within Shariah has likewise gained traction in the market. Sukuks are among the most prevalent. These are essentially Shariah compliant bonds. Yet whereas standard bonds pay investors a set rate of interest over a period of time, sukuks offer a fixed rate of profit instead, thus avoiding forbidden riba. Another important distinction is that sukuks must be backed by some tangible asset, such as properties or a Shariah compliant business. Ownership is transferred to the investors who then lease the asset to the issuer for a set period, essentially charging rent for its use, an arrangement known in Islamic finance as ijarah. \"So with a sukuk, the investor owns a piece of the asset,\" said M. Yaqub Mirza, chief executive officer of Sterling Management Group in Herndon, Va. \"With a bond, it is a debt, and you earn interest on it, which is noncompliant with Shariah.\" In 1986, Dr. Mirza introduced the Amana Income Fund, the first Shariah compliant mutual fund in the United States. Shariah compliant exchange traded funds (E.T.F.s) are another attractive product for Muslim investors. Whereas a standard E.T.F. is a security that tracks an index, commodity, bonds or an index fund, an Islamic E.T.F. exclusively tracks a benchmark index composed of Shariah compliant companies. They are also usually overseen by a Shariah committee to ensure compliance. Saving for retirement the Muslim way involves \"very intentional investing that is consistent with values,\" said Josh Zinner, the chief executive of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, in a telephone interview from his office in New York. Yet whether driven by conscience or a keen sense of the market, Muslim and non Muslim investors alike have historically done well by parking retirement savings in the Islamic financial sector, particularly during volatile times. Both WorldCom and Enron were removed from the Dow Jones Islamic Market Index when their debt levels hit 33 percent, the Shariah cutoff. Shares of both companies later lost their value after they collapsed in 2001 2. More recently, halal investors similarly weathered the financial crisis of 2008 in relative safety, Mr. Orzano observed. \"During that specific time frame, when the financial sector was devastated, being in a Shariah compliant investment was beneficial,\" he said.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Your Money"}
{"text": "Rare Necklaces and Rings Are Items to Appreciate. Just Ask Investors. Diamonds, as the song says, are a girl's best friend. But certain diamond jewelry like rings, bracelets and earrings can be a great investment. This week, Tiffany Company, the established American jeweler, celebrated its 180th anniversary, while Sotheby's hosted an auction in London that sold 2.57 million pounds (about 3.5 million) worth of jewelry. The market for high end baubles remains strong. Rahul Kadakia, international head of jewelry at Christie's in New York, said jewelry sales had been strong for the last three years, driven by the prices of colored diamonds like blues and pinks, which are rarer than white diamonds. Last year, the auction house sold a 14.6 karat vivid blue diamond in Geneva for 57.5 million, or just under 4 million a karat. Twenty years earlier, it sold a different vivid blue diamond in Geneva for 500,000 a karat. But necklaces, rings, bracelets and other pieces made by top designers Bulgari, Boucheron, Cartier, Tiffany and Van Cleef Arpels during their signature periods continue to appreciate. Jewelry, of course, has an intrinsic value. It's made of gems like diamonds, emeralds, rubies and sapphires and set in metals like platinum, gold and silver that are valuable in their own right. Many pieces also have sentimental value, having come from family members or been given on a special occasion. But the pieces with the most investment potential have a level of craftsmanship in addition to scarcity that makes them stand out from the beautiful baubles that are produced year after year and appreciate beyond the value of their metals and gems. These are not the run of the mill pieces that mall jeweler might sell. In fact, people buying these pieces would be hard pressed to see significant appreciation over time. She singled out a pink tourmaline ring designed by Paloma Picasso for Tiffany. When she showed it to an appraiser, she said, \"He said you couldn't buy that pink tourmaline alone today for what you paid for the ring 10 years ago.\" Alison Minton, a philanthropist in Manhattan, bought a limited edition Alhambra necklace by Van Cleef Arpels in malachite 10 years ago. The clover style of the necklace has become well known, but the company made only 100 of the necklaces and numbered each one. Ms. Minton sold it recently for more than 12,000, which was double what she had paid for it. \"It was a great investment, and I wore it,\" she said. From her grandmother, who was part of the family that founded Bloomingdale's, she inherited a rarer piece of jewelry with a better story. In 1964, her grandmother went to the World's Fair in Queens; when she came home, her apartment had been burglarized and her jewelry was gone. Instead of trying to replace the stolen items, she bought a single piece: an 18 karat gold bracelet with rubies and sapphires from Tiffany. It cost about 400 at the time. When Ms. Minton took it to Tiffany for a repair in 2002, the jeweler valued it at 9,000. \"I don't know what it's worth today,\" she said. \"I don't wear it often because it's so special.\" In the annals of rare jewelry for sale sits Pope Paul VI's ring and cross. After the pontiff addressed the United Nations General Assembly in 1965, he donated his diamond encrusted papal ring and diamond and emerald cross to the U.N., so they could be sold to help the poor. At one point, the stunt driver Evel Knievel owned them. Bill Rau of M.S. Rau Antiques said he had acquired the set through a couple in North Carolina. It is priced at 1.9 million. Like any object, from art to cars to jewelry, the fallback position if the investment fails is to consider the aesthetics of the piece. And that's a benefit, because sometimes the jewelry turns out to be worth less than the value of its stones and metal because of that very same uniqueness. It could be difficult to wear or it could be valuable but out of fashion. David Webb, a jewelry maker active in the 1950s to early 1970s, designed a necklace with 682 karats of opals and used smaller emeralds and diamonds to separate the pearl shaped stones. The 36 inch necklace is for sale at 335,000. For people approaching jewelry for investment purposes, strategy and advice count for a lot. First, they have to think of the brand. There are a half dozen jewelry designers that are known worldwide for their quality. That recognition makes reselling their jewelry easier. \"Every time something from the 1920s, 1950s and 1970s from Van Cleef, Cartier, Boucheron comes up for auction, they always do significantly better than they did the first time around,\" Mr. Kadakia of Christie's said. Of course, not all brands make great pieces all of the time (and many lesser known designers have produced fantastic pieces, like Mr. Webb's opal necklace, that stand out). But for the big houses, time periods matter for investing. \"Of all the periods people want to collect, I always tell them Art Deco of the 1920s and 1930s,\" said Diane Lloyde Roth, owner of L'Armoire, a store in New Canaan, Conn., that has been selling investment quality jewelry for three decades. It \"was probably the most beautiful period of all in jewelry production.\" She recalled some of the pieces she sold to Anne Lichtblau, a philanthropist who died last year. Mrs. Lichtblau bought a Van Cleef mystery set ruby bracelet for 140,000 in 2003; her estate sold it at auction last year for 348,500. Mrs. Lichtblau also bought a 1920s emerald, ruby and diamond bracelet by Oscar Heyman Brothers in 1998 for 90,000. It sold for 223,500 at auction last year. \"She always wanted Art Deco,\" Ms. Roth said. \"She bought what she loved, but she spent real money on jewelry.\" Scarcity is important. Colored diamonds fit into this category because they are not as plentiful as white diamonds. Ms. Minton said she bought a bracelet from Verdura that the jeweler had made as a prototype and jokes that she keeps checking with the jeweler to make sure it hasn't made another one. The location where a jeweler made a piece can also affect its value. For instance, vintage Cartier pieces made in France are worth more than Cartier pieces made in New York, Ms. Roth said. When it comes to Tiffany, which of the jeweler's designers made the piece matters considerably. Pieces made by Jean Schlumberger in the 1950s and 60s are more valuable than other Tiffany pieces from the same time because of his style but also his limited production. And jewelry made by Louis Comfort Tiffany, son of the company founder Charles Tiffany, from the 1880s to 1910 commands a greater premium still. He is known for his stained glass lamps and precious objects, but Mr. Rau said he made about 100 pieces of jewelry as well. Yet that scarcity and a lack of knowledge among buyers increases the need to be aware of fakes. \"I go to the cities where people have worn Tiffany or Van Cleef through the years, and family members have sold them,\" said Allison Weiss Brady, a fund raiser in New York. \"One of the keys is buying it from someone you trust,\" she said. But even then, she asks for documents proving the piece's history and also the basics on the gemstones. Contemporary jewelry is a tougher market for buyers to predict investment potential. The top houses are still producing exceptional pieces, but given the high cost of metals and stones, many of the pieces are lighter and less intricate than a generation ago. \"When all of your raw materials go up, something's got to give somewhere,\" Ms. Roth said. There are exceptions, like the Parisian designer JAR, the initials of Joel Arthur Rosenthal. When Ellen Barkin, the actress, sold jewelry given to her by her ex husband, the billionaire Ronald O. Perelman, she had 17 pieces by JAR, who produces fewer than 100 pieces a year. One pair of JAR earrings at last year's auction fetched 1.8 million.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Your Money"}
{"text": "SEVEN years ago, Steve E. Norwitz, who was then a 61 year old executive at the Baltimore mutual fund group T. Rowe Price, proposed a scaled down work schedule that would reduce his duties. \"I didn't figure it would go beyond two years,\" said Mr. Norwitz, who started working at T. Rowe Price in 1977. In fact, \"10 years ago, I thought I'd retire at 60.\" Now 68, he is still at it. Instead of managing the media relations department, as he once did, Mr. Norwitz now works on specific projects and takes 13 weeks off a year. He accepted a 25 percent cut in pay in exchange for more personal time to spend with his wife, a retired teacher and tutor, and to attend cultural events and travel. Since then, they have cruised the Rhine and visited places like Ecuador, China and Slovenia. Like an increasing number of older Americans, Mr. Norwitz opted for a \"phased\" retirement that scales back work over a period of years instead of a cold turkey withdrawal from the work force. As many Americans enjoy greater longevity and a healthier old age, they are seeking more flexibility in their work schedules. Many of them simply want to stay connected to their workplace and colleagues while others are seeking an improved work life balance with more time for involvement with their families and communities. Others need to work or have to build up their nest eggs. \"Few employers have formal programs,\" said Helen Friedman, director of global work force analytics and planning for Towers Watson, a human resources consulting firm. \"Phased retirement can look quite different across organizations, although the biggest challenge employers are trying to address is simple: replacing people with critical skills.\" Phased retirement may be offered in bits and pieces, like fewer hours or off site work. Nearly half of human resource professionals surveyed by the Society for Human Resource Management, a trade organization, said they \"offered reduced hours or part time positions to older workers.\" About 40 percent said they \"hired retired employees as consultants or temporary workers.\" According to an AonHewitt/AARP survey published last year, roughly 80 percent of workers in their 50s or older said they would be interested in the opportunity to stay in the work force in a more limited capacity past their planned retirement date. \"They are picking up in momentum,\" said Roselyn Feinsod, senior partner in the retirement practice at the insurance and human resources firm AonHewitt and an author of the AARP study. \"It's part of a broader approach to offer flexibility in the workplace.\" For workers who are winding down their careers, the opportunity to make a gradual and productive departure has great appeal. Beyond the need to sustain their income, many enjoy the immersion of work and the learning and social opportunities it offers. And a tapered exit can help avoid some of the tensions that may arise at home when plunging into full time retirement. \"It helps to have outside interests and your spouse's support,\" Mr. Norwitz said. \"When I first broached the subject with my wife who had already retired years before her immediate response was: 'O.K., but if you think you're going to sit around here playing the piano all day you have another think coming.' \" Locast, a nonprofit streaming service for local TV, is shutting down Capital One's chief executive was fined after being called a 'repeat offender.' For employers, phased retirement not only helps them retain experienced employees whose skill sets are not easily replaced, but also keeps valued people around to help guide younger employees. It is costly to replace experienced workers ranging from about 7,000 to 32,000, depending on the industry the AonHewitt/AARP study found. Since there is no standard template for phased retirement, those considering the move can often customize their arrangement. One of the many variations of phased retirement is leaving the full time work force, then re entering on a project specific or part time basis, or in a specialized role. Mike Mouton, 71, a former petroleum engineer for Halliburton, the oil field services company, left his company in 2009 when he was 65, only to be asked back to serve in a recruitment role. These \"boomerang\" retirees are often asked to perform jobs well suited to their experience, skills and personality, although on a limited basis. When Mr. Mouton returned to his new company role Halliburton was expanding and needed new engineers he worked mostly from home for about three years, then returned to full retirement. \"When the company first contacted me after I retired the first time, I felt there was a degree of boredom in my life,\" Mr. Mouton said. He was playing golf several times a week at the time. \"They caught me at the right time. It was an opportunity for me to stay in the game. It really felt like a good fit. I also felt I was providing a service and a chance to renew acquaintances.\" So if you are interested in a phased retirement for yourself, how should you proceed? Start by figuring out whether you can afford to live on a reduced income. If you want to cut back at 62, for example, you will be eligible to receive Social Security, but at sharply reduced levels compared with the disbursements upon retiring at 66, now considered the full retirement age. A better move would be to postpone drawing Social Security as long as possible. Social Security will give 8 percent more in payments for every year after full retirement that you delay taking benefits, up to age 70, leading to a significantly larger income for the rest of your life. That is one of the best insurance policies you can buy. Also, you will not qualify for Medicare until you are 65, which could mean facing higher health insurance costs depending on how your employer handles your coverage during a phased retirement. \"Every year you work, it adds two more years to your assets,\" said Kristi Sullivan, a Denver based certified financial planner who has advised her father, Mr. Mouton. \"It's important to plan ahead, preferably five years in advance. Whether you can do it depends upon the individual, their assets and their health.\" Talk with a trusted adviser like a financial planner or an accountant. Consider asking for a computerized \"Monte Carlo\" simulation to see how long your nest egg will hold up under different situations. If the numbers still look good, then decide what you want from your employer. How many hours do you want to work, and how often do you want to be in the office? How much of a salary cut will you consider? Can you work remotely? When do you want to be completely out of your company's sphere? Finally, you will need a yardstick to measure how well your new retirement transition is working. Ms. Feinsod suggests that you fully discuss with your employer the \"roles and skills required, measures of success and a rate of comparable pay.\" If you find a workable arrangement, which could require some fine tuning, you may find that the flexibility offers a chance to balance work and leisure well into your 60s, 70s or beyond, without going overboard on either.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Your Money"}
{"text": "NASA has urged spectators to stay away from the Kennedy Space Center for Wednesday's SpaceX launch to limit the spread of the coronavirus. But officials from cities and counties around the launch site, an area known as Florida's Space Coast, are expecting large crowds to gather to watch the country's first astronaut launch in nine years. The size of the crowds could still be affected by the weather, local officials said. People would be less likely to make the trip if it looked like the forecast might delay the launch. But local news outlets reported launch viewers were already gathering along the beaches and roadways in prime viewing areas on Wednesday morning. Last month, Jim Bridenstine, the NASA administrator, asked people to watch the launch from their homes. \"When we launch to space from the Kennedy Space Center, it draws huge, huge crowds and that is not right now what we're trying to do,\" he said at a news conference. The visitor center at Kennedy, usually a prime spot for spectators, will remain closed to the public. The launch of SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, carrying two NASA astronauts, Douglas G. Hurley and Robert L. Behnken, is scheduled for 4:33 p.m. But outside Kennedy Space Center, NASA has little control over crowds. Peter Cranis, executive director of the Space Coast Office of Tourism, said he expected a couple hundred thousand people to flock to the beaches and parks, noting that launches in NASA's glory days had drawn as many as half a million spectators. Mr. Cranis said he anticipated that the coronavirus might deter some, but that many would still come to witness the historic launch. More than a dozen beachside hotels each with several thousand rooms reported that they were fully booked before the launch, he said. \"Judging from the crowds on Memorial Day weekend, I would say that people are ready to get out,\" Mr. Cranis said. \"They seem to be very happy to be able to be out.\" Law enforcement officials did not provide their own projections of expected crowd sizes. Don Walker, the communications director of Brevard County Emergency Management, said that he was also anticipating big crowds on beaches and roadways, and that departmental staff would ask spectators to keep at least six feet of distance. Kennedy Space Center is in Brevard County. \"Obviously, we cannot be everywhere at once,\" Mr. Walker said. \"But where we can and where we see groups in proximity and in violation of C.D.C. recommendations, the plan is to simply remind people to take heed.\" At a May 1 news conference, Brevard County's sheriff, Wayne Ivey, encouraged people to come watch the launch in person. \"We are not going to keep the great Americans that want to come watch that from coming here,\" Sheriff Ivey said. \"If NASA is telling people to not come here and watch the launch, that's on them. I'm telling people what I believe as an American. And so NASA has got their guidelines, and I got mine.\" Officer Tod Goodyear, a spokesman for the Brevard County Sheriff's Office, said that concerns about the coronavirus prompted the department to seek law enforcement officers from several jurisdictions to be on the ground to help monitor crowds. Officer Goodyear said he expected some people would wear masks and most would be mindful of keeping distance. The sheriff's office will also be distributing up to 20,000 masks to those who request them. With around 400 recorded cases, Brevard County hasn't been hit hard by the virus. And since Gov. Ron DeSantis began reopening the state on May 4, Officer Goodyear said he had noticed more people out and about. Ben Malik, the mayor of Cocoa Beach, about a 40 minute drive south from the space center, said he was expecting several thousand people to visit its beach, which is about six miles long. \"It's physically impossible to manage,\" Mr. Malik said. \"We don't have the police resources to go out there and keep everyone apart. The best we can do is try to manage the traffic and crowd control.\" Lt. Kim Montes, a spokeswoman for the Florida Highway Patrol in Orlando, said the agency was focused on monitoring traffic and making sure people wouldn't stop their cars on bridges. In addition to the couple dozen officers normally on duty, an additional 30 troopers from other parts of the state will assist during the day, she said. \"With the pandemic, we really don't know what kinds of crowds we are going to have,\" Lieutenant Montes said. \"The weather is going to play a lot into it. Are people going to stay home? Is it going to rain?\"", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Health"}
{"text": "Ever since the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine began last spring, upbeat announcements were stalked by ominous polls: No matter how encouraging the news, growing numbers of people said they would refuse to get the shot. The time frame was dangerously accelerated, many people warned. The vaccine was a scam from Big Pharma, others said. A political ploy by the Trump administration, many Democrats charged. The internet pulsed with apocalyptic predictions from longtime vaccine opponents, who decried the new shot as the epitome of every concern they'd ever put forth. But over the past few weeks, as the vaccine went from a hypothetical to a reality, something happened. Fresh surveys show attitudes shifting and a clear majority of Americans now eager to get vaccinated. In polls by Gallup, the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Pew Research Center, the portion of people saying they are now likely or certain to take the vaccine has grown from about 50 percent this summer to more than 60 percent, and in one poll 73 percent a figure that approaches what some public health experts say would be sufficient for herd immunity. Resistance to the vaccine is certainly not vanishing. Misinformation and dire warnings are gathering force across social media. At a meeting on December 20, members of an advisory panel to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cited strong indications that vaccine denouncements as well as acceptance are growing, so they could not predict whether the public would gobble up limited supplies or take a pass. But the attitude improvement is striking. A similar shift on another heated pandemic issue was reflected in a different Kaiser poll this month. It found that nearly 75 percent of Americans are now wearing masks when they leave their homes. The change reflects a constellation of recent events: the uncoupling of the vaccine from Election Day; clinical trial results showing about 95 percent efficacy and relatively modest side effects for the vaccines made by Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna; and the alarming surge in new coronavirus infections and deaths. \"The Biden administration, returning to listening to science and the fantastic stats associated with the vaccines,\" she replied. The lure of the vaccines' modest quantities also can't be underestimated as a driver of desire, somewhat like the must have frenzy generated by a limited edition Christmas gift, according to public opinion experts. That sentiment can also be seen in the shifting nature of some of the skepticism. Rather than just targeting the vaccine itself, eyebrows are being raised across the political spectrum over who will get it first which rich individuals and celebrities, demographic groups or industries? But the grim reality of the pandemic with more than 200,000 new cases and some 3,000 deaths daily and the wanness of this holiday season are perhaps among the biggest factors. \"More people have either been affected or infected by Covid,\" said Rupali J. Limaye, an expert on vaccine behavior at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \"They know someone who had a severe case or died.\" Dr. Limaye concluded: \"They are fatigued and want to get back to their normal lives.\" A barrage of feel good media coverage, including rapt attention given to leading scientists and politicians when they get jabbed and joyous scrums surrounding local health care workers who become the first to be vaccinated, has amplified the excitement, public opinion experts say. There remain notable discrepancies among demographic groups. The divide between women and men has become pronounced, with women being more hesitant. Black people remain the most skeptical racial group, although their acceptance is inching up: In September, a Pew Research poll said that only 32 percent of Black people were willing to get the vaccine, while the latest poll shows a rise to 42 percent. And though people of all political persuasions are warming to the vaccine, more Republicans than Democrats view the shot suspiciously. A brighter indication, he said, is that two thirds of the public say they are at least somewhat confident that a coronavirus vaccine will be distributed in a way that is fair, up from 52 percent in September. The most pronounced pockets of resistance include rural residents and people between the ages of 30 and 49. Timothy H. Callaghan, a scholar at the Southwest Rural Health Research Center at Texas A M School of Public Health, said that rural residents tend to be conservative and Republican, characteristics that also show up among the vaccine hesitant. They also include immigrants and day laborers, many of whom do not have college degrees or even high school diplomas and so may be more dismissive of vaccine science. \"They appear less likely to wear masks, less likely to work from home and there is an opposition to evidence based practices,\" Dr. Callaghan said. The resistance also springs from their hampered access to health care in remote areas. In addition, the need to take off several hours of work from the inflexible demands of farming for travel and recovery from vaccine side effects makes the shots seem even less compelling, he added. About 35 percent of adults between 30 and 49 over all expressed skepticism about the vaccine, according to the Kaiser poll. Dr. Scott C. Ratzan, whose vaccine surveys in New York with the City University of New York Graduate School of Public Health echo findings similar to the national polls, noted that this group doesn't keep up on flu shots either. They are well out of the age range for routine vaccines. \"There is no normalizing or habit for this age group to get vaccinated,\" he said. Black people have remained the most resistant to taking a coronavirus vaccine, largely because of the history of abusive research on them by white doctors. But their willingness to consider it is ticking up. In the Kaiser poll, the share of Black respondents who believe the vaccine will be distributed fairly has nearly doubled, to 62 percent from 32 percent. Mike Brown, who is Black, manages the Shop Spa, a large barbershop with a Black and Latino clientele in Hyattsville, Md. This summer he told The Times that he was happy to sit back and watch others get the vaccine, while he bided his time. \"The news that it was 95 percent effective sold me,\" Mr. Brown said. \"The side effects sound like what you get after a bad night of drinking and you hurt the next day. Well, I've had many of those and I can deal with that to get rid of the face masks.\" Still, he says, many customers remain skeptical. He tells them: \"What questions do you have that you're leery about? Just do your investigation and follow the science! Because if you're just talking about what you won't do, you're becoming part of the problem.\" Another group that has been uncertain about taking the vaccine is health care workers, who typically have high rates of acceptance for established vaccines. In recent weeks, some hospital executives have said that many on their staffs were balking. ProPublica reported that a hospital in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas had to offer some allotted doses to other medical workers in the area, because an insufficient number of their own workers came forward. A sheriff's deputy and a state senator got in line. But other hospitals say that staff time slots for the vaccine are becoming a hot commodity. For months, Tina Kleinfeldt, a surgical recovery nurse at Long Island Jewish Medical Center, a hospital in the Northwell Health network, had absolutely no intention of getting the vaccine until long after the science and side effects had been established. Last week, she was randomly offered a rare vaccination slot. Still she refused, despite the admonitions of envious colleagues. Then she began thinking of all the Covid 19 patients she had cared for and the new ones she would inevitably encounter. She thought about her husband and three children. She thought: Well, I can always cancel the appointment at the last minute, right? Then she realized that doses were still so scarce that she might not get another opportunity soon. So she said yes. She became the first nurse on her unit to get the shot. Afterwards , she felt some muscle soreness at the site of injection. But she also felt elated, excited and relieved.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Health"}
{"text": "WASHINGTON Move over, millennials. The centenarians are coming. The number of Americans age 100 and older those born during Woodrow Wilson's administration and earlier is up by 44 percent since 2000, federal health officials reported Thursday. There were 72,197 of them in 2014, up from 50,281 in 2000, according to the report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 1980, they numbered about 15,000. Even demographers seemed impressed. \"There is certainly a wow factor here, that there are this many people in the United States over 100 years old,\" said William H. Frey, the senior demographer at the Brookings Institution. \"Not so long ago in our society, this was somewhat rare.\" Not only are there more centenarians, but they are living even longer. Death rates declined for all demographic groups of centenarians white, black, Hispanic, female, male in the six years ending in 2014, the report said. Women, who typically live longer than men, accounted for the overwhelming majority of centenarians in 2014: more than 80 percent. Centenarians are an elite group. Most people born in 1900 did not live past 50. But chances of survival to such ripe ages have improved with the rise of vaccines and antibiotics, and improvements in hygiene, medical treatments and technology. There are exceptions: The explosion of opioid overdose deaths in recent years has erased progress for some groups, particularly young and middle age whites. Malvina Hunt, a resident of central New York, who turned 100 in October, said her secret was vigorous exercise. Every morning, she does leg lifts and rapid arm raises to get the blood flowing. Now that it is winter, she does not venture out very much, except to the mailbox. But in summer, she spends a lot of time outside, gardening and mowing the lawn. And she still works as a greeter in a winery. She also helps build cartons used to ship wine. \"My motto was always, 'If I could do it today, I'll be able to do it tomorrow,' \" she said. She said she knew two other centenarians, a friend from high school and a friend from college, both women. Whites are driving the aging of America. In the last full census in 2010, the median age for whites was 42, far older than the Hispanic population, whose median age was 27. Baby boomers, a large bulge in the population, have started to enter retirement and will soon be bumping up the numbers of the elderly to record levels. Experts are warning that the United States is unprepared to handle such large numbers of seniors, especially as the life expectancy of older people continues to rise. \"We are moving into a very different country this century,\" Mr. Frey said. \"It's the very tip of the iceberg.\" Even for centenarians, life spans are growing longer. Death rates for centenarian women dropped 14 percent in the six years ending in 2014, to 36.5 per 100 women, and by 20 percent to 33.2 per 100 men. Among racial and ethnic groups, Hispanic centenarians had the lowest death rate, 22.3 per 100 people, compared with 39.3 per 100 whites and 28.6 per 100 blacks. Death rates from Alzheimer's disease increased the most over the period of the report, up 119 percent from 2000 to 2014. Death rates from hypertension also jumped 88 percent over the period. Death rates for influenza and pneumonia fell by 48 percent, for stroke by 31 percent and for heart disease by 24 percent. Even so, heart disease remained the leading cause of death for centenarians in 2014.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Health"}
{"text": "When Julian Olidort returned to his Manhattan office after a business trip to Israel five years ago, he said his first priority was \"to assemble a team of co workers\" to assist in the delicate handling of a once in a lifetime opportunity that emerged 6,000 miles away in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. It was an investment he was eager to pursue. Her name was Sivan Aloni. \"She was a very beautiful and intelligent woman with a very different outlook on life,\" Mr. Olidort said. \"She lived every day at her own pace, and that was something I deeply admired, so I thought if there was ever a chance to meet her again it would be so magical, so worth it.\" Mr. Olidort, now 29 and an associate at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and Ms. Aloni, now 31 and the adviser to Ambassador Dani Dayan, consul general of Israel in New York, met in Jerusalem in May 2014 at the first Genesis Prize award ceremony. The annual event recognizes achievement steeped in Jewish values. (Michael R. Bloomberg was the first recipient.) \"Looking back, that was a lot for a young guy to handle,\" Mr. Olidort said with a chuckle, \"but then again, so was Sivan.\" Ms. Aloni, then a 26 year old student at Hebrew University of Jerusalem working for the Israeli production company that produced the event, was stationed in the guest relations area in charge of coordinating the flow of journalists, panel judges and other attendees during the course of the evening. \"I saw her standing there and just kind of froze for a moment,\" Mr. Olidort recalled. \"I immediately told myself, 'If this girl could be the one, then I'm satisfied, I'm set for life.'\" Unsure how he might relay that sentiment to a woman he had never met in a room teeming with security guards and media personnel, Mr. Olidort continued to stare squarely at Ms. Aloni as he began walking in circles. \"I wanted to look busy,\" he said, \"so I walked out of the room three times, and each time I had to re enter through security.\" Ms. Aloni, who was in the company of several colleagues, could not help but notice the peripatetic stranger who appeared to not know whether he was coming or going. \"I glanced over and saw this guy who looked dashing in his suit,\" she said. \"He also looked like he was half the age of everyone else in attendance.\" Mr. Olidort decided the best plan would be to make a beeline for Ms. Aloni, and upon arrival, he did not mince words. \"Look, I don't want to embarrass you in front of your friends,\" he said to her, \"but may I have your number, I'd love to take you out.\" Ms. Aloni, who said she found Mr. Olidort's bold approach \"rather charming,\" agreed to have a drink with him later that night, which was a Thursday, but in the company of friends. Mr. Olidort, scheduled to return to New York the next day, chose to join her friends. Despite the fact that he did not get the alone time with her that he desired, he said he awoke the next morning \"feeling that she was someone I would flip the whole world over to be with.\" He rearranged his travel plans, canceling a trip to Turkey and extending his time in Israel by three more days until a Tuesday to get to know Ms. Aloni on a more personal level. He told her he was staying to take care of some unfinished business, but failed to tell her that she, in fact, was the unfinished business. He asked her out to dinner on a Saturday evening, and though Ms. Aloni accepted the invitation, she arrived with several friends in tow, leaving Mr. Olidort a bit flustered. He explained his frustration to her the next morning, on a Sunday, two days before he was to return to New York, and followed his one on one request with yet another dinner invite, this one to Manta Ray, a restaurant on the beach in Tel Aviv. Ms. Aloni accepted, agreeing to go solo, she said, \"because I could tell by then that Julian was a very sincere person, and a really nice guy.\" Mr. Olidort settled in and the two got to know each other. Ms. Aloni told him that she was born in Petah Tikva, a city in the central district of Israel, and raised in Tel Aviv, the only daughter of Zivit Furstenberg, her mother, who lived in Korazim, Israel, and Raviv Aloni, her father, an information technology specialist who remarried after divorcing Ms. Furstenberg and moved to Brisbane, Australia. Ms. Aloni spent many of her summers in the company of her stepsister and stepbrother in Australia. She graduated from Thelma Yalin National High School of the Arts in Tel Aviv, before serving two years in the Israeli Army, where she was a sergeant in its Yiftah unit, which developed materials for special infantry operations. She went on to Hebrew University, earning a dual degree in Jewish thought and political science. Ms. Aloni and Mr. Olidort soon realized that art played an integral role in both their lives. Her mother was an independent jewelry artist. His mother, Nadia Klionsky Olidort, was a landscape artist and the senior studio artist for the Echo Design Group in New York, where she designs scarves. She inherited her artistic talent from her father, Marc Klionsky, a Soviet born artist who developed a nuanced form of American Realism through the eyes of new immigrants in New York City in the 1970s and 1980s. Mr. Klionsky, who died at age 90 in 2017, painted the portraits of many notable leaders and musicians, including Golda Meir, B.B. King and Dizzy Gillespie the latter still hanging at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington. Mr. Olidort, the younger of two sons born to Ms. Klionsky Olidort and Joseph Z. Olidort of New York, graduated from Brandeis University and received a master's degree in international finance and economic policy from Columbia. He was a Fulbright scholar in Sweden, where he conducted economic research on the Swedish glass industry while blowing glass at a factory in the southern Smaland region. He later told Ms. Aloni that after meeting her in Jerusalem, he returned home so fearful of losing her \"by saying the wrong thing,\" that he turned to his co workers \"for some advice and coaching,\" on what they felt were the proper things to say to maintain his newfound, long distance relationship. \"For two months, people kept popping into my office with new ideas, new things to say to her via phone or text,\" Mr. Olidort said. Six months later, Mr. Olidort's emotional investment began paying dividends, as he and Ms. Aloni arranged for a second official date in Venice, Italy. \"He was always up front about his feelings for me,\" Ms. Aloni said. \"So at that point, I had put a lot of trust and faith in him.\" Their rendezvous in Venice, Mr. Olidort said, \"felt more like an incredible honeymoon than a second date.\" In February 2015, Ms. Aloni visited Mr. Olidort in New York, where she did some sightseeing, job hunting and soul searching. In October of that year she returned once more, this time considerably shortening the distance of their long distance relationship by moving into Mr. Olidort's Manhattan apartment. She had also accepted a job as a director in the public diplomacy department of the Israeli consulate. \"Throughout our relationship Julian kept talking about getting serious and wanting us to have a great life together, and that always felt right with me,\" Ms. Aloni said. \"So I moved in with him without hesitation and without worry.\" They were married on a Tuesday morning, April 2, by Rabbi Haskel Lookstein at Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun in Manhattan. The couple were joined by the groom's parents and his grandmother, Irina Klionsky, who is also the widow of Marc Klionsky. Renee Schreiber and Eran Polishuk, colleagues and friends of the bride, also attended. The bride's mother tuned in via Skype from her home in Israel. \"By the power vested in me as a rabbi and because of the fact that I registered with the city clerk 60 years ago in order to be able to do such a ceremony, I now pronounce you husband and wife, according to the law of the State of New York,\" Rabbi Lookstein said playfully. \"You are not yet married according to the law of Moses and Israel.\" When the brief ceremony ended, the small wedding party went to a nearby deli to celebrate over coffee and bagels. \"We fell in love with Sivan the moment we met her,\" said the groom's mother, Ms. Klionsky Olidort, who was seated inside the deli next to her husband, Joseph Olidort, a civil engineer at Aecom, an engineering firm in New York. \"She is his sunshine, the person who brings him the most joy.\" The newlyweds would eventually call a cab for Irina Klionsky, 82, and escort her back to her SoHo apartment, where she and Mr. Olidort manage her husband's art estate. It was also the place where Mr. Olidort proposed to Ms. Aloni in March 2018. (Mr. Olidort said he hoped to put together an exhibit in the near future of Mr. Klionsky's works, several pieces of which have never been on public display.) \"The Jewish community is an important part of our lives,\" Mr. Olidort said. \"We are both passionate about the continuity of the Jewish people and innovative Jewish education to inspire and engage young people to remain involved with their Jewish heritage.\" On April 16, the bride and groom will take part in a celebration ceremony in Jerusalem before 300 family members and friends. Rabbi Lookstein will officiate again at a traditional huppah and reception at Olmaya, an events space there. \"I only wish my husband was here to see all of this,\" said Irina Klionsky, smiling before her cab arrived as she stared across the crowded deli at the bride and groom. Standing side by side at the noisy deli counter after their wedding, the couple laughed as they pointed to a variety of bagels and other tempting choices on a menu hanging high on a wall above a colorful and somewhat chaotic New York scene. This was modern day portrait of youthful exuberance the likes of which Marc Klionsky might have captured in his heyday.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Fashion & Style"}
{"text": "The tennis player Madison Keys, 21, who is competing for the United States in the Rio Olympics, will also be one to watch at the United States Open, starting at the end of this month. The hard hitting upstart has been making waves with her baseline game since she turned pro at 14 and has been hailed as the face of the next generation of American women's tennis. When it comes to tending to her actual visage, Ms. Keys, who grew up in Iowa and now lives in Boca Raton, Fla., says her beauty regimen is a mix of her upbringing and her demanding practice and travel schedule. Since I practice early in the morning on most days, I wake up and wash my face with Clean Clear Morning Burst. I feel like it actually does wake me up a bit. Then the first thing I put on is sunscreen. I do it within 15 minutes of waking up so I'm protected by the time I'm out the door. I use the Neutrogena oil free sport formula for the face. For the body, I use Neutrogena Wet Skin spray. I try to get at least SPF 50 on me. After practice, I hit the shower, of course. I'm obsessed with the Bath Body Works Warm Vanilla Sugar line. Someone gave it to me when I was 14, and I've been using it ever since. I use the sugar scrub and body wash and lotion. Sometimes you think maybe you should outgrow certain products and try something else, but I still really like it. I use moisturizer only at night Philosophy Hope in a Jar. Two or three times a week, I do a Caudalie face mask. It's a purifying one because I have combination skin, and I'm sweating so often. It can be really tough to keep clear skin, especially if you're wearing a visor. It's just sitting on your head, and you break out underneath it. It can be a disaster. I have pretty even skin tone, but being out in the sun all the time, I get red cheeks and a red nose. I don't like heavy foundation, but if I use something tinted, it helps blend everything together. I've been using Urban Decay One Done it has primer, SPF and a tint in it. For eyeliner, I use the Urban Decay 24/7 pencils. I use black or brown most of the time, but if I'm going out, I like purple because it sets off my green eyes. I also use Benefit They're Real mascara. For eye shadow, I love the Urban Decay Naked palette because it has so many colors all right there. Then I use the Urban Decay setting spray. It's so good. Otherwise, living in Florida, you'll go outside for 20 minutes and realize, \"Oh, my mascara is sliding off my face.\" I tend not to wear blush, but I do love highlighter: Benefit Watt's Up. If I'm going out, I put it on my nose, my cupid's bow, under my brows and on my cheekbones. I've always been more of an eye person, but recently I've been really getting into lip colors. I like the Tarte matte lip stains. They travel well and stay all day. I'm on Instagram a lot. There are so many makeup artists doing looks, and that's why I'm so into lip color now. Sometimes I'll just go in my \"Explore\" page and look for videos, but mostly I follow WakeUpandMakeup. When I was at the Australian Open this year, one of the player gifts was a department store voucher. I wanted a new fragrance. The second I tried Giorgio Armani Si, I loved it. I've been wearing it for six or seven months now. It's usually straight up into a bun when I wake up. But at the end of the day, I let it down. Every girl who has really curly hair fights it at some point, but I've become way more open to wearing it natural, and I'm loving it. I use the Bumble and bumble curly hair line that's shampoo, conditioner and styling. I'm constantly in the sun, and my hair is pulled back tight, which can cause so much breakage. Sometimes I'll just leave the conditioner in for an entire day. I also love putting in coconut oil. My natural color is a really, really dark brown. Right now, it's dark at the roots, but I wanted to go a little lighter for summer, so there are some blond pieces, like balayage. I get manicures and pedicures every two weeks. For my manicures, I get gel. Colors, I usually go with black and dark purple, but sometimes I do a navy. I really like Lincoln Park After Dark by OPI. I have a physical therapist who travels with me. He's actually a chiropractor, but he also does acupuncture, so I get acupuncture almost every day. I've had lots of injuries in the last couple of years, so I had to take that extra step to hire somebody. I hate needles, but this doesn't hurt. It's really interesting how one day acupuncture can be used to treat muscle soreness, and another day for relaxation, and it'll put me right to sleep.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Fashion & Style"}

{"text": "I'm a Doctor in Italy. We Have Never Seen Anything Like This. MILAN None of us have ever experienced a tragedy like it. We know how to respond to road accidents, train derailments, even earthquakes. But a virus that has killed so many, which gets worse with each passing day and for which a cure or even containment seems distant? No. We always think of calamity as something that will happen far from us, to others far away, in another part of the world. It's a kind of superstition. But not this time. This time it happened here, to us to our loved ones, our neighbors, our colleagues. I'm an anesthesiologist at the Policlinico San Donato here in Milan, which is part of the Lombardy region, the heart of the Italian coronavirus outbreak. On Feb. 21, the day on which the first case was recorded, our hospital, which specializes in cardiac surgery, offered to help with the care of patients with Covid 19. Along with other hospitals, we created a task force of intensive care doctors to be sent to hospitals in the \"red zone.\" All planned surgeries were postponed. Intensive care beds were given over to the treatment of coronavirus patients. Within 24 hours, the hospital created new intensive care places by converting operating theaters and anesthetic rooms. And 40 more beds were dedicated to patients suspected or proven to have the virus, though not in a serious condition. The patients who arrive remain for many days, straining medical resources. Already across northern Italy in Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia Romagna and Marche health care systems are under enormous stress. Medical workers are exhausted. As the virus spreads, other regions will soon find themselves in the same situation. Fortunately, Lombardy and the national government adopted aggressive containment measures 10 days ago. By the end of this week after 15 days, the incubation period of the infection we will see whether such measures have been effective. Only then might we see a slowing down in the spread of the virus. It cannot come too soon. There has been speculation that doctors may be forced to decide whom to treat, leaving some without immediate care. That's not my experience: All patients at my hospital have received the treatment they require. But that may not last. If the number of patients infected does not start to drop, our resources won't stretch to cover them. At that point, triaging patients to give priority to those with more chances of survival may become standard practice. My colleagues, at the Policlinico and throughout the country, are showing a great spirit of sacrifice. We know how much we are needed right now; that gives us strength to withstand fatigue and stress. How long such resistance will last, I cannot say. Some colleagues have tested positive for the coronavirus, and a few have needed intensive care. For us all, the dangers are great. As an anesthesiologist devoted to surgical emergencies, I haven't had many direct dealings with coronavirus patients. But there was one. An elderly man in a fragile condition, he was set to have tumor removed. The surgery proceeded as normal: I put him to sleep, and he awoke four hours later, without pain. That was in mid February. A week later, the telltale symptoms began to show: a high fever, a cough. Before long, pneumonia. Now he's in intensive care, intubated and in a critical condition. He is one of many who have become a number without a name, one of those that represent the worsening of the situation. I hope the beginning of the end of this outbreak will be soon. But we will know that it's coming only if and when the infections begin to decline. The population's calm response to the restrictive rules imposed by the government, the experience gained in the management of critically ill patients and the rumors of new treatments for the infection are grounds for hope. Perhaps the containment measures will work, and the news at the end of the week will be good. But for now, we are in the thick of tragedy.

{"text": "The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values . It is separate from the newsroom. From the start, the Trump Russia story has been both eye glazingly complex and extraordinarily simple. Who is Oleg Deripaska? What's the G.R.U. again? Who owed what to whom? The sheer number of crisscrossing characters and interlocking pieces of evidence the phone calls, the emails, the texts, the clandestine international meet ups has bamboozled even those who spend their days teasing it all apart. It's no wonder average Americans tuned out long ago. A bipartisan report released Tuesday by the Republican controlled Senate Intelligence Committee cuts through the chaff. The simplicity of the scheme has always been staring us in the face: Donald Trump's 2016 campaign sought and maintained close contacts with Russian government officials who were helping him get elected. The Trump campaign accepted their offers of help. The campaign secretly provided Russian officials with key polling data. The campaign coordinated the timing of the release of stolen information to hurt Hillary Clinton's campaign. The Senate committee's report isn't telling this story for the first time, of course. (Was it only a year ago that Robert Mueller testified before Congress about his own damning, comprehensive investigation?) But it is the first to do so with the assent of Senate Republicans, who have mostly ignored the gravity of the Trump camp's actions or actively worked to cast doubt about the demonstrable facts in the case. It's also a timely rebuke to the narrative that Attorney General William Barr has been hawking since before he took office early last year that \"Russiagate\" is a \"bogus\" scandal. Mr. Barr and other Trump allies claim that the Russia investigation was begun without basis and carried out with the intent of \"sabotaging the presidency.\" That argument has been debunked by every investigative body that has spent any time looking into what happened, including the nation's intelligence community, Mr. Mueller's team, the Justice Department's inspector general and now the Senate Intelligence Committee. In fact, the committee report, which is nearly 1,000 pages long and is the fifth in a series examining Russian interference in 2016, goes further than Mr. Mueller's investigation. For example, Mr. Mueller declined to say whether Mr. Trump had lied under oath when he said that he did not recall speaking with Roger Stone, his longtime aide and confidant, about WikiLeaks, which released the batches of emails stolen by the Russians. But the Senate committee found that the president \"did, in fact, speak with Stone about WikiLeaks and with members of his campaign about Stone's access to WikiLeaks on multiple occasions.\" The committee documented that, on Oct. 7, 2016, Mr. Stone received advance notice of the impending release of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape, in which Mr. Trump brags about sexually assaulting women. In response, Mr. Stone made at least two phone calls arranging for WikiLeaks to release stolen internal emails from the Democratic National Committee. The report also found that Konstantin Kilimnik, a longtime business associate of Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, was a Russian intelligence officer, and may have been linked to the Russian military's hacking and leaking of the D.N.C. emails in the first place. Mr. Trump and his allies will parse and prevaricate forever. Ignore them. If it wasn't already overwhelmingly clear what was going on, it is now. As the Democrats on the committee put it in an appendix to the report: \"This is what collusion looks like.\" Alas, the Republicans refused to join in on this straightforward assessment, stating in their own appendix that \"we can now say with no doubt, there was no collusion.\" That is to insist that up is down. But call it whatever you like: The Intelligence Committee report shows clear coordination between Russians and the Trump campaign, though there is no evidence of an explicit agreement. The evidence the report lays out suggests Mr. Trump knew this at the time. Whether or not it can be proved that he ordered this interference or violated the law in doing so, the fact remains that neither he nor anyone else in his campaign alerted federal law enforcement authorities, as any loyal American should have. And remember: Mr. Trump tried this scheme again. The president was impeached for his efforts to invite foreign interference in the 2020 election, this time by Ukraine, again on his behalf. Part of that requested interference involved an attempt to smear Joe Biden. But the other part involved pinning the 2016 election interference on Ukraine rather than on Russia. Who was \"almost certainly\" one of the primary sources spreading that claim in the media, according to the senators' report? None other than Konstantin Kilimnik. There has never been any reliable evidence that Ukraine interfered in 2016; the Senate committee concluded as such, in line with all previous investigations. Russia is now attempting to help Mr. Trump again this November, according to American intelligence assessments reported in The Times. For any normal president, that would be a top of mind concern, and he or she would be marshaling all available resources to thwart it. What has Mr. Trump done? On Sunday night, he retweeted Russian propaganda that the U.S. intelligence community had already flagged as part of that country's efforts to skew the election. On Monday, Miles Taylor, a former chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security in the Trump administration, wrote that the president \"showed vanishingly little interest in subjects of vital national security interest, including cybersecurity, domestic terrorism and malicious foreign interference in U.S. affairs.\" He added, \"the country is less secure as a direct result of the president's actions.\" There's no way to sugarcoat it. In less than three months, the American people could re elect a man who received a foreign government's help to win one election and has shown neither remorse nor reservations about doing so again.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Opinion"}
{"text": "Our public messaging about the virus should explain the real costs in graphic terms of catching the virus. I still remember exactly where I was sitting decades ago, during the short film shown in class: For a few painful minutes, we watched a woman talking mechanically, raspily through a hole in her throat, pausing occasionally to gasp for air. The public service message: This is what can happen if you smoke. I had nightmares about that ad, which today would most likely be tagged with a trigger warning or deemed unsuitable for children. But it was supremely effective: I never started smoking and doubt that few if any of my horrified classmates did either. When the government required television and radio stations to give 75 million in free airtime for antismoking ads between 1967 and 1970 many of them terrifyingly graphic smoking rates plummeted. Since then, numerous smoking \"scare\" campaigns have proved successful. Some even featured celebrities, like Yul Brynner's posthumous offering with a warning after he died from lung cancer: \"Now that I'm gone, don't smoke, whatever you do, just don't smoke.\" As the United States faces out of control spikes from Covid 19, with people refusing to take recommended, often even mandated, precautions, our public health announcements from governments, medical groups and health care companies feel lame compared to the urgency of the moment. A mix of clever catchphrases, scientific information and calls to civic duty, they are virtuous and profoundly dull. The Centers for Diseases Control urges people to wear masks in videos that feature scientists and doctors talking about wanting to send kids safely to school or protecting freedom. Quest Diagnostics made a video featuring people washing their hands, talking on the phone, playing checkers. The message: \"Come together by spending time apart.\" As cases were mounting in September, the Michigan government produced videos with the exhortation, \"Spread Hope, Not Covid,\" urging Michiganders to put on a mask \"for your community and country.\" Forget that. Mister Rogers type nice isn't working in many parts of the country. It's time to make people scared and uncomfortable. It's time for some sharp, focused terrifying realism. \"Fear appeals can be very effective,\" said Jay Van Bavel, associate professor of psychology at New York University, who co authored a paper in Nature about how social science could support Covid response efforts. (They may not be needed as much in places like New York, he noted, where people experienced the constant sirens and the makeshift hospitals.) I'm not talking fear mongering, but showing in a straightforward and graphic way what can happen with the virus. From what I could find, the state of California came close to showing the urgency: a soft focus video of a person on a ventilator, featuring the sound of a breathing machine, but not a face. It exhorted people to wear a mask for their friends, moms and grandpas. But maybe we need a P.S.A. featuring someone actually on a ventilator in the hospital. You might see that person \"bucking the vent\" bodies naturally rebel against the machine forcing pressurized oxygen into the lungs, which is why patients are typically sedated. Another message could feature a patient lying in an I.C.U. bed, immobile, tubes in the groin, with a mask delivering 100 percent oxygen over the mouth and nose eyes wide with fear, watching the saturation numbers rise and dip on the monitor over the bed. Maybe some P.S.A.s should feature a so called Covid long hauler, the 5 percent to 10 percent of people for whom recovery takes months. Perhaps a professional athlete like the National Football League's Ryquell Armstead, 24, who has been in and out of the hospital with serious lung issues and missed the season. These P.S.A.s might sound harsh, but they might overcome our natural denial. \"One consistent research finding is that even when people see and understand risks, they underestimate the risks to themselves,\" Mr. Van Bavel said. Graphs, statistics and reasonable explanations don't do it. They haven't done it. Only after Chris Christie, an adviser to President Trump, experienced Covid, did he start preaching about mask wearing: \"When you have seven days in isolation in an I.C.U. though, you have time to do a lot of thinking,\" Mr. Christie said, suggesting that people, \"follow C.D.C. guidelines in public no matter where you are and wear a mask to protect yourself and others.\" We hear from many who resist taking precautions. They say, \"I know someone who had it and it's not so bad.\" Or, \"It's just like the flu.\" Sure, most longtime smokers don't end up with lung cancer or tethered to an oxygen tank either. (That, in fact, was the justification of smokers like my father, whose two pack a day habit contributed to his death at 47 of a heart attack.) These new ads will seem hard to watch. \"We live in a Pixar era,\" Mr. Van Bavel reflected, with traditional fairy tales now stripped of their gore and violence. But studies have shown that emotional ads featuring personal stories about the effects of smoking were the most effective at persuading folks to quit. And quitting smoking is much harder than social distancing and mask wearing. Once a vaccine has proved successful and enough people are vaccinated, the pandemic may well be in the rearview mirror. In the meantime, the creators of public health messaging should stop favoring the cute, warm and dull. And at least sometimes scare you.

{"text": "The Aman Spa at the Connaught hotel in London, part of the Maybourne Hotel Group, is such a proponent of the benefits of meditation that it is opening its doors to the public for the first time with free 20 minute classes every weekday. The sessions are held at 1 p.m. in a treatment room at the spa and are limited to eight participants. They are led by therapists trained in mindfulness meditation, which is an adaptation of Buddhist meditation that encourages one to focus on the moment rather than being consumed by the pain of the past or anxiety over the future. Guests should reserve a spot through phone or email and will be welcomed in the lobby by an Aman representative and ushered to the spa. They can arrive 10 minutes early to enjoy lemon grass or ginger tea or stay to drink a cup after class. Meditation can help renew your mind and spirit, according to the spa manager, Rene Van Eyssen. \"It encourages you to observe your emotions, which improves awareness of the present moment, bringing clarity and peace,\" she said.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Travel"}
{"text": "The first thing a visitor to Suerte might notice after opening the menu is a section cheekily titled \"Vitamin T\" a collection of the restaurant's takes on a variety of regional Mexican classics: tacos, tostadas, tamales, tlacoyos. But those dishes have something in common that could have resulted in a \"Vitamin M\" section: masa, the corn based dough that is their central focus and, indeed, the restaurant's. The mission of Suerte, which opened in March in East Austin, said Fermin Nunez, its 30 year old executive chef, is \"creating this beautiful thing called masa, which is the canvas for so much Mexican cooking.\" The masa is made in house, using corn sourced from two local producers: red corn from Richardson Farms, and heirloom white and green from Barton Springs Mill. \"Every night and into the next morning,\" Mr. Nunez said, \"we make masa.\" On a summer visit to Suerte, the various iterations of masa were indeed delicious, both earthy and sweet. Carnitas tlacoyo, shaped like elongated footballs, were pleasantly soft and refried beans and salsa verde added extra character. Less successful was the quesadilla del tule, a taste muddle of squash, Oaxacan cheese, peppers and a pumpkin seed and pistachio salsa. But the star of the T dishes was the suadero tacos, packed with meltingly soft confit brisket, an avocado salsa cruda and something the menu calls \"black magic oil\" (actually a combination of morita chile, fermented black beans, black sesame seeds and oil). It is also worth venturing beyond the Vitamin T section. From \"Frio Raw,\" we tried the bright and spicy aguachile, with royal red prawns in a cascadel chile broth, topped with a dark, crunchy cracker (made from masa, of course). Out of \"Specialties\" we sampled a wildly flavorful barbacoa of goat ribs, served with two types of salsa, housemade queso fresco and a basket of tender tortillas. And the \"Vegetables\" section yielded a perfect stand in for dessert: peaches and mangos, which arrived prettily dressed in a Latin spin on green goddess dressing.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Travel"}
{"text": "From about 1,755 Hong Kong dollars (or about 225, at 7.8 Hong Kong dollars to the dollar) Opened last year, the 32 room Olympian Hong Kong offers a rare amenity in one of the densest, most property crunched cities in the world: breathing space. An enormous five tiered chandelier, elegant wingback chairs, and overflowing bouquets of (very realistic) fake flowers complete with customized scent adorn the serene, marble clad entrance lobby; hotel guests go up an escalator for check in with a dedicated \"guest ambassador.\" All rooms are on the second floor of the One Silversea private residence building, with cushy seating areas overlooking the lobby. This is clubby, apartment style living for less, made possible with a quieter location just off the beaten path. West Kowloon, on the water with tree framed views of the Kowloon skyline anchored by the distinctive 118 floor International Commerce Center tower, known for having a rooftop sky bar that's the tallest in the world (it's so tall that it's often shrouded in clouds). Across a pedestrian footbridge from the hotel is the Olympian City mall and the Olympic MTR subway station, with easy access to Kowloon and Central stations. It's also close to the glittering shopping bazaar of Tsim Sha Tsui, and convenient to the China Macau Ferry Terminal and to the airport by train or taxi. Massive and opulent, with 11 foot ceilings, lacquered wood sliding doors and gold accented everything, from the bird sculpture art pieces to the blackout curtains. Our room, in the lowest \"deluxe\" category, was more of a suite: 463 square feet with floor to ceiling windows and a city view. Just off the hallway from the front door is a kitchenette, with full size fridge, pantry space, microwave, Nespresso machine and teakettle. Down the hallway is an enormous bathroom, a separate living room with a couch and table, and the bedroom. Sadly, the generous wraparound outdoor patio is not accessible to hotel guests because of the upper floor residences. Our host, Yoyo, told us that housekeeping has found cigarette butts and eggs \"you know, like a sunny side up egg?\" on the deck, tossed out by residents above. The bathroom alone is the size of a Manhattan studio. But it actually contains multiple rooms: a toilet (with telephone), a massive glass doored rainhead shower room that might as well have its own ecosystem, and a separate spa tub with headrest. Each room has a complimentary smartphone for you to use out on the town, with free calls and Wi Fi it comes preloaded with helpful features like maps, city guides, shopping and ticket discounts, currency calculators, and a local phone number for people to reach you. There's also a fitness center, and a laundry room for guest use extremely rare in Hong Kong, and tremendously useful for those staying longer than a week. The hotel also offers Rolls Royce limousine service (for roughly double the price of a taxi). A 24 hour private lounge serves complimentary drinks and snacks. There's also room service, offering an all day menu of items including soy sauce chicken wings (88 Hong Kong dollars), spaghetti Bolognese (108 Hong Kong dollars), and grilled minced beef and potato (88 Hong Kong dollars). But you're in Hong Kong and Kowloon has some of the best eating districts in Hong Kong so the street is really your restaurant. Room to roam apartment style living in a city where space is at a serious premium. Convenient to the airport and Kowloon's attractions, it's a luxuriant, calm oasis amid the Hong Kong hubbub, and surprisingly affordable.", "label": 0, "original_task": "N24News: A New Dataset for Multimodal News Classification", "original_label": "Travel"}
